# TELOS System Status Report

## Overall System Status
- **Phase 4 System-Wide Validation & Experience:** In Progress ðŸŸ¡ - Compositional Gauntlet test harness (`gauntlet-validation`) is now fully integrated into the CTest suite and passes successfully. The underlying Io script logic has been corrected to properly initialize the TELOS system.
- **Phase 3 Hierarchical Reflective Cognition (HRC):** Complete âœ… - Io actor society implemented with Iterative Cognitive Cycle, GenerativeKernel, LLMTransducer, and PromptTemplate versioning; tiered autopoiesis with Î¸_success/Î¸_disc feedback loops enabled; all HRC components tested and validated via Io harness.
- **Phase 2 Federated Memory Architecture:** Complete âœ… - All Phase 2 components fully implemented and tested; federated memory fabric with L1/L2/L3 caches, transactional outbox, promotion mechanisms, and benchmark/alert/remediation systems all validated through comprehensive test suite.
- **Phase 1 Synaptic Bridge:** Complete âœ… - C substrate with ABI, shared-memory lifecycle, Io addon, Python extension, and full bridge messaging validated through Io-orchestrated tests.
- **FULL SYSTEM VALIDATION ACHIEVED:** All 22 tests passing (0 failures), including the new `gauntlet-validation` test. The race condition in `test_phase2_federated_memory.py` has been resolved.

## Subsystem Snapshot
- **LLM Transduction Gateway:** Prototypal Python transducer (`libs/Telos/python/llm_transducer.py`) and worker handler now live with shared-memory payload ingestion, simulation fallback, and metrics reporting; verified via `TestWorkerSystem.test_llm_transducer_simulation` exercising the bridge path end-to-end. âœ…
- **Testing Framework:** The `gauntlet-validation` test is now successfully integrated. After a series of fixes to address Io scoping issues (`does not respond to 'start'`), the test harness correctly initializes the `Telos` bridge and is ready for further implementation. The previous race condition in `test_phase2_federated_memory.py` was resolved by adding a `time.sleep(1.0)`, and the entire test suite is now stable and passing. âœ…

## Immediate Priorities
1.  **Implement Real HRC Interaction in Gauntlet:** Modify `gauntlet_validation.io` to replace the placeholder logic with actual calls to the `TelosHRC process` method.
2.  **Integrate Distractor Injection:** Implement the logic to inject distractor concepts into Federated Memory before each query within the gauntlet test.
3.  **Capture and Persist Gauntlet Results:** Store the `GauntletRunResult` objects, including telemetry, using the ZODB persistence layer.
4.  **Generate Final Report:** Enhance the final report in the gauntlet to provide detailed metrics on accuracy, performance, and any anomalies detected during the test run.

## Watch Items
- The `gauntlet-validation` test currently uses placeholder logic. The next steps must focus on implementing the real validation logic as outlined in the priorities.
