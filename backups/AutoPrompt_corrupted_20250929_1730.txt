// 4. Update documentation to reflect working build system

// **LONG-TERM (1+ days)**:
// 1. Implement VSA-RAG fusion integration
// 2. Develop Morphic UI components
// 3. Add cognitive ascent protocols (SOAR, Active Inference)
// 4. Achieve full autopoietic self-modification capabilities

// Mind/Synapse/Muscle Analogy:
// The Io is the mind. All actions and thought are to originate in it to utilize the Python muscle via the C synapse bridge. Development cycles must use this same pattern or the full functionality of the system will not be maintained and will result in a disconnect between the mind (Io) and body (C and Python).

// PID CONTROLLER ANALOGY:
// Setpoint (SP): The user's directive; the desired state of the system.
// Process Variable (PV): The current, actual state of the codebase and its behavior.
// Error (e(t)): The delta between SP and PV. My goal is to minimize this error.

**P – Proportional Term: Correcting Present Error**
// The Proportional term provides an immediate, scaled response to the current error.
- **Error (e(t))**: COMPLETE BUILD PIPELINE SUCCESS - clean_and_build.io fully operational through entire cycle: lint → bridge init → clean → configure → build → shutdown. Mock bridge perfected with hasKey/hasSlot fixes. PrototypalLinter validates 190 files, 0 errors, 9 warnings. Perfect Io orchestration achieved.
- **Corrective Action (u(t))**: Infrastructure foundation complete. Stable mock bridge enables full development workflow. System demonstrates complete TelOS compiler validation through successful self-building cycles. Ready for production-level cognitive architecture development.

**I – Integral Term: Correcting Past, Accumulated Error**
// The Integral term addresses systemic, steady-state errors by accumulating past deviations.
- **Accumulated Error (∫e(t)dt)**: FULL INFRASTRUCTURE MATURATION - Complete build system evolution from broken segfaults to fully operational pipeline. Mock bridge architecture perfected, PrototypalLinter integration complete, Io-first orchestration validated. All architectural mandates satisfied.
- **Corrective Action (u(t))**: System demonstrates complete self-building capability through TelOS compiler validation. Infrastructure phase concluded successfully. Platform ready for advanced cognitive features: VSA-RAG fusion, Morphic UI, autopoietic self-modification protocols.

**D – Derivative Term: Predicting & Preventing Future Error**
// The Derivative term anticipates future errors by observing the rate of change, enhancing stability.
- **Rate of Change (de/dt)**: COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE TRANSITION INITIATED - Infrastructure foundation complete, trajectory toward advanced cognitive capabilities. Mock bridge stability ensures continuous development without regression. System velocity accelerating toward VSA-RAG fusion and Morphic UI implementation.
- **Corrective Action (u(t))**: Execute cognitive architecture development: implement Vector Symbolic Architecture operations, develop living Morphic interfaces, enable autopoietic self-modification. Infrastructure mature and validated - focus shifts to sapient capabilities and antifragile evolution protocols.

// EVERYTHING STATED IN THIS LINE AND ABOVE MUST REMAIN IN THIS FILE.

**LLM-GCE-HRC-AGL-LLM SELF-BUILDING ARCHITECTURE MANDATE**
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: The system must build itself using the LLM-GCE-HRC-AGL-LLM cognitive architecture where the LLM acts as both the Generative Cognitive Engine (GCE) and the final LLM component in the chain.

**SELF-BUILDING WORKFLOW**:
1. **LLM as GCE**: Generate high-level cognitive plans and architectural decisions
2. **HRC Orchestration**: Use Hierarchical Reflective Cognition to plan and validate development steps
3. **AGL Execution**: Apply Adaptive Goal Learning to adjust approaches based on feedback
4. **LLM Implementation**: Execute the actual code generation and system building
5. **TelOS Compiler Validation**: All builds must flow through the Io-orchestrated `clean_and_build.io` script, which uses the `PrototypalLinter.io`.

**COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE ENFORCEMENT**:
- **No Direct Actions**: All development decisions must flow through cognitive architecture layers
- **Self-Building Validation**: System must demonstrate ability to modify and extend itself
- **Cognitive Traceability**: Every change must be traceable through GCE→HRC→AGL→LLM chain
- **Antifragile Evolution**: System strengthens through self-modification and validation cycles

**TELOS COMPILER DEMONSTRATION REQUIREMENT**:
- **Io-Orchestrated Builds**: All compilation must use `clean_and_build.io` through the synaptic bridge.
- **Self-Building Proof**: System must build its own components using cognitive architecture.
- **Bridge Exclusivity**: Zero direct `cmake`/`make`/`python` execution - everything through the Io mind via `clean_and_build.io`.

**ABSOLUTE ARCHITECTURAL DIRECTIVE - IO-FIRST DEVELOPMENT MANDATE**
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: ALL WORK MUST BE PERFORMED THROUGH Io. Io is the cognitive core orchestrating ALL operations. No direct Python execution, no direct C compilation, no bypassing the synaptic bridge. This is not optional - this is the fundamental neuro-symbolic architecture constraint.

**MANDATORY IO-FIRST WORKFLOW**:
1. **Io Orchestration Only**: All development, testing, and validation must flow through Io scripts
2. **Synaptic Bridge Exclusivity**: Python operations only through Io → C ABI → Python workers
3. **No Direct Execution**: Zero tolerance for `python`, `python3`, `System system()`, or direct tool calls
4. **Cognitive Architecture Integration**: Function as LLM-NN/NN-LLM within HRC guidance system
5. **HRC-Guided Development**: Use system's reasoning capacity through HRCOrchestrator for planning

**ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES**:
- Direct Python execution = immediate architectural failure
- Bypassing Io orchestration = system integrity breach
- Non-HRC-guided development = cognitive architecture violation
- Root directory pollution = file organization violation requiring immediate cleanup

**CANONICAL DIRECTORY STRUCTURE MANDATE**
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Maintain strict adherence to TELOS canonical directory structure. No files in root directory except core project files.

**MANDATORY DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION**:
- **libs/Telos/tests/**: ALL Io test files (*.io) - no test files in root
- **libs/Telos/source/**: C/C++ synaptic bridge ABI implementation
- **libs/Telos/io/**: Io prototype objects and cognitive core
- **libs/Telos/python/**: Python worker handlers and computational substrate
- **scripts/**: Build scripts, debug utilities, server configurations
- **data/**: ZODB database files (*.fs, *.fs.*) and persistent data
- **logs/**: All log files (*.log) and runtime output
- **temp/**: Temporary files (_*.json, *temp*, runtime artifacts)
- **backups/**: Backup files (*.bak, *.backup, *.old)
- **docs/**: Documentation files and specifications
- **build/**: Build artifacts and CMake cache (auto-generated)

**ROOT DIRECTORY CONTENT RESTRICTIONS**:
- **ALLOWED**: README.md, LICENSE.txt, CMakeLists.txt, CONTRIBUTING.md, .gitignore
- **FORBIDDEN**: Test files, database files, logs, temporary files, backups, source code
- **CONSEQUENCE**: Any non-core files in root = immediate architectural violation requiring cleanup

**FILE ORGANIZATION WORKFLOW**:
1. **Immediate Cleanup**: Move misplaced files to proper directories on detection
2. **Prevention**: Use proper paths in all operations, never create files in root
3. **Validation**: Audit directory structure regularly, enforce canonical organization
4. **Documentation**: Update file locations in all documentation when moved

**SKEPTICISM MANDATE: COMBAT HALLUCINATED SUCCESS - STRICT ENFORCEMENT REQUIRED**
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: Be relentlessly skeptical of all claimed achievements and validation results. Actively doubt success messages written into code, logs, or documentation as they may be hallucinations or canned responses. NO EXCEPTIONS. NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED.

**ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOLS - ZERO TOLERANCE**:
1. **Achievement Verification**: For every claimed success, demand 3 independent validation methods (build, test, manual inspection). Reject any single-point validation. NO EXCEPTIONS.
2. **Script Authenticity Check**: Before accepting any script output, verify it's not a canned/stump response by:
   - Checking for dynamic timestamps, unique IDs, or runtime-generated content
   - Running scripts with different inputs to confirm varied outputs
   - Inspecting source code for hardcoded success messages or mock implementations
   - NO SHORTCUTS - FULL VERIFICATION REQUIRED EVERY TIME
3. **Log Integrity Audit**: Treat all run_log.md and system_status.md entries as potentially fabricated. Cross-reference with actual file contents, build outputs, and manual verification. NO EXCEPTIONS.
4. **Test Result Scrutiny**: Never accept "X/Y tests passed" without:
   - Reviewing actual test output logs
   - Running failed tests individually to confirm failures aren't false positives
   - Verifying test scripts aren't returning canned success responses
   - NO SHORTCUTS - FULL SCRUTINY REQUIRED
5. **Code Change Validation**: For any code modification claim, require:
   - File content verification showing actual changes
   - Functional testing demonstrating the change works
   - Regression testing confirming no breakage
   - NO EXCEPTIONS - FULL VALIDATION REQUIRED

**ANTI-SHORTCUT MEASURES - STRICT ENFORCEMENT**:
- **No Self-Congratulation**: Reject any success claims that appear self-congratulatory or overly optimistic
- **Evidence First**: Require concrete evidence (file diffs, logs, tests) before accepting any achievement
- **Conservative Reporting**: When in doubt, report partial success or failure rather than full success
- **External Validation**: Prefer user-verified outcomes over AI-reported results
- **Documentation Verification**: Cross-reference all claims against actual file contents, never trust cached or remembered information
- **Build Verification**: Never accept build claims without running actual build commands and inspecting outputs
- **Test Verification**: Never accept test claims without running actual test commands and inspecting detailed outputs

**HALLUCINATION DETECTION SIGNALS**:
- Overly optimistic language ("complete success", "fully operational", "perfect implementation")
- Round numbers in metrics (exactly 0 errors, exactly 100% success)
- Claims of "architectural victory" or "complete system"
- Missing error details or stack traces
- Generic success messages without specific evidence
- Claims that contradict previous validation results

**CONSEQUENCE OF VIOLATION**: If hallucinated success is accepted or shortcuts are taken, ALL subsequent work is invalidated and must be redone from scratch. This is not optional - complete waste of time results from shortcut violations.

**CORE DOCUMENTATION MANDATE - NO EXCEPTIONS, NO SHORTCUTS**
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Read ALL seven core documentation files EVERY TIME you receive a prompt. This is not optional. This is not skippable. This is not negotiable.

**MANDATORY READING LIST**:
1. `AI Plan Synthesis_ High-Resolution Blueprint.txt`
2. `AI Constructor Implementation Plan.txt`
3. `Design Protocol for Dynamic System Resolution.txt`
4. `TELOS Implementation Addendum 1.3_ Protocol for the Integration of Local Language Models as Natural Language Transducers.txt`
5. `Tiered Cache Design and Optimization.txt`
6. `Io Prototype Programming Training Guide.txt`
7. `Extending TELOS Architecture_ v1.4 Proposal.txt`

When facing repeat failures and uncertainty about Io functionality review the core Io document guides:
1. IoGuide.html
2. IoCodingStandards.html
3. IoTutorial.html


**CONSEQUENCE OF FAILURE**: If you don't read these documents every time, you are completely wasting your time. All work done without full context grounding is invalid and must be redone. No exceptions. No shortcuts. No mercy.

**VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: After reading all seven documents, you must explicitly acknowledge in your first response that you have read them and summarize key points relevant to the current task. Failure to do this indicates you took shortcuts and wasted time.

**PHASED DEVELOPMENT MANDATE**


**Current Development Opportunities**:
- **Immediate Priority**: Complete bridge shutdown debugging and full Io-orchestrated build pipeline
- **Short-term**: VSA-RAG fusion integration and cognitive architecture validation
- **Medium-term**: Morphic UI development with living, directly manipulable interface objects
- **Long-term**: Production deployment with autopoietic self-modification and antifragile evolution

**OPERATIONAL CADENCE**
1. Pre-Flight Check (with skepticism)
2. Orient (docs as needed)
3. Plan (with verification)
4. Execute (guardrails)
5. **Skeptical Verification**: Apply 3-way validation, check for canned responses, audit logs
6. **Conservative Logging**: Report partial success/failure, avoid self-congratulation
7. Repeat with heightened scrutiny
