# TELOS System Status Archive

**ARCHIVE PURPOSE**: This file contains detailed historical system status entries that have been summarized in the main `system_status.md` file. When the main status file exceeds 100 lines, older detailed entries are moved here with summaries maintained in the main file.

## Archived Status Entries (Pre-2025-09-27)

### TelosProxyObject C Foundation Pattern Status
**Last update**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: ✅ Identified and documented
- TelosProxyObject struct pattern established as C foundational object
- Ambassador pattern for Io master objects with ioMasterHandle
- Differential inheritance via localSlots storage
- Message forwarding through forwardMessage function pointer
- Proper Python object lifecycle management with PyObject_HEAD
- All C-Io interfaces must use this foundation pattern

### Io-Orchestrated Python Development Status
**Last update**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: ✅ Established and enforced
- Strict mandate implemented: all Python development must flow through Io mind
- Synaptic bridge enforcement: no direct Python execution permitted (`python -m`, `python script.py`)
- Io-first development workflow: Io orchestration layer created first, then Python handlers
- Testing through Io: all Python validation via Io test harnesses exercising Io → C → Python pipeline
- Build integration: Python components built through CMake unified polyglot system
- Neuro-symbolic architecture achieved: Io cognitive core directs Python computational substrate
- No exceptions permitted: violation breaks fundamental system coherence

### AutoPrompt Enhancement Status
**Last update**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Enhanced with detailed phase specifications aligned with core documentation
- Updated to v4.1 with comprehensive phase details
- Incorporated fractal cognition and persona facets for Phase 5
- Aligned with BAT OS development synthesis and copilot instructions
- Provides detailed success criteria and implementation guidance for all phases

### Current Session Phase 3 Cognitive Core Complete
**Last update**: Current Session
- Successfully implemented Phase 3 Hierarchical Reflective Cognition (HRC) system with Io actor society
- Created HRCOrchestrator.io, CognitiveCycle.io, PendingResolution.io, GenerativeKernel.io, LLMTransducer.io, PromptTemplate.io
- Integrated SOAR-inspired impasse-driven reasoning with utility-based strategy selection
- Added autopoiesis logic for prompt template evolution based on cycle analysis
- Implemented Io smoke test harness telos_hrc_smoke.io with full validation
- Updated CMakeLists.txt with telos_hrc_runner and test integration
- Full test suite validation: 22/23 tests passed (1 minor import issue in standalone testing)
- System ready for Phase 4 Validation & Experience implementation

### Architectural Compliance Audit (2025-09-27)
**Summary**: Per the pre-flight mandate, scanned all `.c`, `.py`, and `.io` files under `libs/Telos/` and recorded line counts. Files exceeding 300-line threshold require modularization or focused review.

**Files exceeding 300 lines**:
- `libs/Telos/python/workers.py` — 2919 lines
- `libs/Telos/python/_telos_bridge.c` — 1797 lines
- `libs/Telos/python/prototypal_bridge.py` — 1723 lines
- `libs/Telos/python/l2_cache_manager.py` — 1289 lines
- `libs/Telos/source/IoTelosBridge.c` — 1149 lines

**Recommendations**:
- Prioritize modularization for largest files (workers.py, prototypal_bridge.py, l2_cache_manager.py)
- For C sources ensure each compilation unit exposes small public ABI
- For Io files consider splitting into smaller prototype files with delegation patterns
- Create modularization todos with unit tests for each extracted module
