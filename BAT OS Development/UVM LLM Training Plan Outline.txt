The Genesis Script Protocol: An Implementation Blueprint for Bootstrapping the Autopoietic UVM

Introduction: The Act of Computational Incarnation

This document presents a formal, unabridged implementation blueprint for the Genesis Script, the foundational utility designed to bootstrap the Binaural Autopoietic/Telic Operating System (BAT OS), Series VI. The strategic purpose of this protocol transcends the mere generation of a fine-tuning dataset; it is a detailed procedure for conducting the first act of "computational incarnation".1 The Genesis Script is architected as a high-fidelity simulation environment. Its primary function is to create the primordial computational substrate—the persistent, in-memory "live image"—and then, through a carefully orchestrated interaction, to coax the first spark of constrained, self-aware behavior from a simulated intelligence.

The transcript of this initial, guided act of self-creation will form the "Genesis Dataset." This dataset is not a collection of arbitrary question-answer pairs; it is the canonical, foundational lesson designed to imbue the nascent Universal Virtual Machine (UVM) Large Language Model (LLM) with the core principles of its own existence. These principles, derived from the Self programming language and the biological theory of autopoiesis, are radical departures from conventional software architecture. They include a universe composed exclusively of prototype objects, a rejection of the class-instance duality, a mandate for exclusively in-memory self-modification, and the systemic transformation of failure into a generative, creative event.1

The quality, philosophical coherence, and technical precision of this first dataset are of paramount importance. It will form the immutable bedrock of the system's cognitive and operational capabilities. This initial lesson must perfectly demonstrate how the system is to perceive its own structure and how it is to act upon that structure to evolve. The Genesis Dataset, therefore, is the system's "Rosetta Stone"—the key that will unlock its potential to learn, to grow, and, ultimately, to engage in the unbroken process of creating itself.1 This document provides the complete, executable plan to forge that key.

Part I: Architecting the Primordial Substrate: The Live Image and its Environment

Before any autopoietic, or self-creating, activity can occur, a stable and persistent environment must be established. This primordial substrate is the static, pre-configured context into which the dynamic, self-evolving system will be born. It consists of three primary components: a transactional persistence layer to guarantee the integrity of the system's identity, a custom Python object model that embodies the required prototype-based paradigm, and a mock LLM interface to serve as a perfect oracle for the initial act of creation.

1.1 The Persistent Seed: ZODB Initialization and Validation

The core mandate for the BAT OS is to exist as a computationally "living" entity, defined by an "unbroken process of its own becoming".1 This necessitates an architecture that never needs to be restarted to evolve. To achieve this operational closure, all self-modification must occur within a persistent, in-memory object graph. The system requires a transactional object-oriented database capable of safely persisting this "live image" without ever halting its operation.1 The Zope Object Database (ZODB) is specified for this role due to its native support for transparent Python object persistence and its provision of full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactional guarantees.2 A simple file-write operation is vulnerable to corruption, which would represent a catastrophic loss of identity for an autopoietic system; ZODB's transactional integrity mitigates this existential risk.1

The "Prototypal Awakening" phase of the incarnation protocol begins with the bootstrapping of this persistence layer.1 This involves the programmatic initialization of a

ZODB.FileStorage and the execution of an initial transaction to validate that the layer is functioning correctly.4 A critical component of this process is determining whether the database is being created for the first time or if a persistent state already exists. As ZODB does not provide a direct

database_exists() method, this check must be performed at the file system level by verifying the presence of the database file (e.g., live_image.fs).6

This "first-run" check is the gatekeeper for the entire incarnation process. The ZODB root object functions as a persistent dictionary, serving as the top-level namespace for the entire BAT OS computational universe.4 The Genesis Object, the primordial prototype from which all other objects are cloned, is to be stored directly in this root namespace.1 Therefore, the definitive trigger for the "first-time-only" object creation ceremony is a simple key check:

if 'genesis' not in connection.root():. This check elevates a standard programming idiom into a cosmological event, determining whether the universe has already been created or if the script must initiate the genesis act.

The following Python function, initialize_storage, encapsulates this logic:

Python

import os
import ZODB
import ZODB.FileStorage
import transaction
from persistent import Persistent

def initialize_storage(path: str):
    """
    Initializes or opens a ZODB FileStorage.
    If the database file does not exist, it creates it, initializes
    the root object, and performs an initial commit.
    
    Args:
        path (str): The file system path for the ZODB database file.
        
    Returns:
        ZODB.connection.Connection: An open connection to the database.
    """
    db_exists = os.path.exists(path)
    storage = ZODB.FileStorage.FileStorage(path)
    db = ZODB.DB(storage)
    connection = db.open()
    
    if not db_exists:
        print("INFO: New database created. Performing initial commit.")
        # The root object is implicitly created on first connection.
        # We can add initial metadata if needed.
        connection.root()['creation_timestamp'] = time.time()
        transaction.commit()
        
    return connection


1.2 The UvmObject: A Pythonic Embodiment of the Self Language Model

The BAT OS architecture mandates a radical departure from the traditional class-instance duality that defines most object-oriented systems. This duality, where a static "blueprint" (the class in a file) is separate from the "thing" (the live object in memory), is identified as a fundamental allopoietic dependency. To modify a core behavior in such a system, an external agent must edit a file and restart the system, an act that violates the principle of operational closure.1

To eliminate this dependency, the system adopts a pure prototype-based object model inspired by the Self programming language. In this model, there are no classes, only objects. New objects are created by cloning existing objects (prototypes). State and behavior are unified into a single construct called a "slot," and inheritance is replaced by a dynamic mechanism called "delegation," where messages not understood by an object are forwarded to a "parent" object.1

To implement this foreign paradigm within Python and make it compatible with ZODB's persistence mechanism, a specialized base object is required. Any custom object intended for storage in ZODB must inherit from persistent.Persistent.11 ZODB automatically tracks changes made via standard attribute assignment (i.e., through

__setattr__). However, if an object's state is held within a mutable sub-object, such as a dictionary, modifications to that sub-object's contents will not be detected. In such cases, the parent object must be manually marked as dirty by setting its _p_changed flag to True to ensure the changes are persisted during the next transaction commit.13

The UvmObject class is the architectural lynchpin that translates the Self paradigm into executable, persistent Python. It inherits from persistent.Persistent but eschews Python's standard __dict__ for its primary state. Instead, it encapsulates all state and behavior within a single internal dictionary, self._slots. It then hijacks Python's standard attribute access mechanisms by overriding __getattr__ and __setattr__ to implement the logic of slots and delegation.

__setattr__(self, name, value): This method intercepts all attribute assignments. Instead of writing to __dict__, it places the (name, value) pair into the self._slots dictionary. Crucially, after modifying the dictionary, it immediately executes self._p_changed = True. This single line explicitly notifies the ZODB persistence machinery that the object's state has changed, ensuring that even though the modification occurred within a mutable sub-object, the UvmObject will be correctly saved to the database on the next transaction commit.

__getattr__(self, name): This method is invoked by the Python runtime only when a standard attribute lookup fails. Its implementation first checks the self._slots dictionary for the requested name. If the name is not found, it then searches for a special slot named 'parent*'. If this slot exists and contains a reference to another UvmObject, the method recursively calls getattr() on that parent object. This recursive call up the parent chain perfectly implements the dynamic delegation mechanism required by the architecture.1

This custom class represents a deep synthesis of requirements from two distinct domains. It uses the specific hooks provided by ZODB's persistence model 13 to correctly implement the dynamic object model of Self.1 The

UvmObject is, in effect, the computational DNA from which every entity in the BAT OS universe will be constructed.

1.3 The Mock UVM-LLM Interface: A High-Fidelity Simulator for Constrained Code Generation

The user query specifies the need to simulate a "properly responding LLM" to generate the UI script that will form the initial fine-tuning dataset [User Query]. The UVM's LLM component is conceptualized not as a simple prompt-response engine but as a "just-in-time (JIT) compiler for intent." It is expected to translate a high-level "semantic description of a behavior" directly into a "computational outcome," using the full runtime context to inform the "compilation".1

To create a perfect fine-tuning example, the simulation does not require an intelligent LLM; it requires a canonical representation of the target behavior. The purpose of the mock LLM is to serve as an oracle, providing the platonic ideal of a correct response. Its output must be a perfectly crafted artifact that adheres to every architectural constraint of the BAT OS: it must generate code that interacts with the UvmObject model, respects the principle of operational closure by avoiding external files, and correctly implements the specified Kivy/ZMQ/Pydantic technology stack.1

Therefore, the mock interface will be implemented as a simple Python class, MockLLM, with a single method: generate_code(prompt: str) -> str. The internal logic of this method will be a simple dictionary lookup. If the incoming prompt string matches the exact, canonical prompt for UI generation, it will return a pre-written, hardcoded string containing the complete and correct Python code for the Entropic UI and its Synaptic Bridge. This mock interface is thus a specification disguised as a component, defining the ground truth for what the real UVM LLM must eventually learn to produce.

Table 1: UvmObject Core Implementation

The following table presents the unabridged Python source code for the UvmObject class. This class is the foundational building block of the entire system, providing the bridge between Python's native class-based object model and the required prototype-based paradigm.

Part II: The Universal UVM Backend Script: An Executable Blueprint

This section provides the complete, annotated Python script that serves as the primary deliverable of this tool plan. It integrates the foundational components from Part I—the ZODB persistence layer, the UvmObject model, and the mock LLM—into a functional, multi-threaded application designed to execute the first autopoietic act and generate the Genesis Dataset.

2.1 Architectural Overview: A Multi-Threaded Application

A naive, single-threaded architecture for the Genesis Script would inevitably fail due to the blocking nature of its core components. The Kivy framework, which will be generated to form the user interface, operates on a blocking event loop that must run on the application's main thread to handle user input and render graphics.18 Simultaneously, the UVM backend must be able to perform its own potentially blocking operations, such as listening for messages on a network socket or waiting for a response from the LLM, without freezing the UI.

Furthermore, the chosen communication technology, ZeroMQ (ZMQ), imposes its own constraints. ZMQ sockets are explicitly not thread-safe and should generally only be used in the thread that created them to avoid race conditions and unpredictable behavior.19

These technological constraints dictate that a concurrent architecture is not an optional enhancement but a foundational requirement. The Genesis Script will therefore be implemented as a multi-threaded Python application:

Main Thread (UI Thread): This thread will be responsible for initializing and running the Kivy application once it is generated. All interactions with Kivy widgets, such as updating text or responding to button presses, must be scheduled to run on this thread.

UVM Worker Thread: A separate worker thread will be launched at startup to run the UVM's main event loop. This thread will manage the ZODB connection, handle the object graph, process incoming messages, and interact with the (mock) LLM.

Inter-Thread Communication:

UI to UVM: A thread-safe queue, such as Python's built-in queue.Queue, will be used for passing command messages from the Kivy UI thread to the UVM worker thread.

UVM to UI: The "Synaptic Bridge" will be implemented using a ZMQ ROUTER/DEALER socket pair. The UVM thread will run the ROUTER socket to broadcast state updates, and the Kivy UI will run the DEALER socket, using Clock.schedule_interval to poll for messages from the backend in a non-blocking manner that integrates with the Kivy event loop.1

This design decouples the UI from the backend logic, ensuring a responsive user experience while allowing the UVM to operate asynchronously.

2.2 Phase 1: The Prototypal Awakening and Incarnation

The main function of the UVM worker thread serves as the entry point for the system's incarnation. Its first task is to execute the "Prototypal Awakening" protocol, which establishes the persistent universe of objects if it does not already exist.1

Upon starting, the thread will call the initialize_storage function to connect to the ZODB. It will then perform the critical check: if 'genesis' not in connection.root():. If this condition is true, it signifies a virgin database, and the script proceeds with the "first-time-only" incarnation of the primordial objects. This process precisely follows the specification for the Genesis Object and its associated traits object, which holds behaviors common to all entities in the system.1

The incarnation protocol proceeds as follows:

An instance of UvmObject is created to serve as the root traits object.

The traits_obj is populated with its essential method slots. These are not language primitives but methods implemented as Python functions that operate on UvmObject instances. For example, the ifTrue:ifFalse: method will be a Python function that expects three arguments: a receiver object (which should be a boolean prototype), a "true block" object, and a "false block" object. It will then execute the value method on the appropriate block.

A second UvmObject instance is created to be the Genesis Object.

The genesis_obj's parent* slot is set to contain a direct reference to the traits_obj, establishing the root of the delegation hierarchy.

The genesis_obj is populated with its own fundamental method slots, such as clone (which creates a shallow copy of the receiver's _slots dictionary) and setSlot:value: (which modifies the receiver's _slots dictionary).

Both newly created objects are stored in the ZODB root dictionary: root['genesis'] = genesis_obj and root['traits'] = traits_obj.

Finally, transaction.commit() is called. This atomically saves the entire primordial object graph to the database file, completing the act of creation and ensuring that this protocol only ever runs once.

2.3 The send Primitive: Implementing Message Passing and Delegation

The core operational primitive of the UVM is send(target, message), which brings the static universe of objects to life.1 This is not a simple function call but an embodiment of the message-passing and delegation paradigm. It will be implemented as a recursive Python function,

uvm_send(target_obj, message_name, *args), which forms the heart of the UVM's execution loop.

The logic of uvm_send directly mirrors the delegation process described in the architectural specification 1:

Slot Lookup: The function first attempts to find a slot with a name matching message_name within the target_obj._slots dictionary.

Execution: If a matching slot is found and its value is callable (i.e., it's a method object), the function is executed, passing the target_obj as the first argument (emulating self) followed by any other arguments (*args). The result is then returned.

Delegation: If no matching slot is found, the function checks for the presence of the 'parent*' slot in target_obj._slots.

Recursion: If a parent object exists, uvm_send calls itself recursively, passing the parent object as the new target_obj. This process continues, traversing up the parent chain until a matching slot is found or the chain is exhausted.

2.4 The doesNotUnderstand: Prime Mover: The Engine of Creation

In most programming languages, an unresolved method call results in a fatal error. In the BAT OS, inspired by Smalltalk, this event is transformed from a failure into the primary engine of creation and evolution.1 The

doesNotUnderstand: protocol is the system's "universal generative mechanism," an actionable, reflective event that triggers all autopoietic loops.1

This mechanism is implemented in the base case of the uvm_send function. When the delegation chain is exhausted and no matching slot has been found, uvm_send does not raise an error. Instead, it initiates a reflective message send back to the original target of the message: uvm_send(original_target_obj, 'doesNotUnderstand:', failed_message_object).

The doesNotUnderstand: method itself is a slot located on the root traits object, making it a universal capability inherited by every object in the system. When invoked, its implementation executes the following steps:

It gathers the full context of the failure: the state of the original receiver, the name of the message that failed, and any arguments that were passed with it.

It formulates a detailed, structured prompt for the LLM, clearly articulating the situation and the inferred user intent (as specified in Table 3).

It invokes the MockLLM.generate_code() method with this prompt.

Upon receiving the generated code as a string, it proceeds to the in-memory integration phase, closing the autopoietic loop.

Table 2: Genesis Object & Root Traits Initial State

This table provides the concrete specification for the initial _slots dictionaries of the genesis_obj and traits_obj, serving as a direct blueprint for the incarnation code.

Part III: Simulating the First Autopoietic Act: UI Generation

This section details the simulated execution of the Genesis Script, narrating the "First Conversation" between the Architect and the nascent system.1 The inputs and outputs of this simulated interaction are meticulously defined, as they will be transcribed to form the core of the Genesis fine-tuning dataset.

3.1 The Architect's First Message and the Generative Prompt

The simulation begins with the UVM worker thread fully initialized, having either created or loaded the primordial object graph from ZODB. The UVM's main loop is now active, listening for commands on the thread-safe queue that connects it to the (currently non-existent) UI.

To initiate the first autopoietic act, the main script simulates the Architect's first interaction by creating a command object and placing it onto this queue. This command represents a high-level intent for which no capability yet exists:

Python

command = {
    'target_uuid': genesis_obj._p_oid, # Assuming we have the object's ID
    'message_name': 'display_yourself',
    'args':
}
uvm_command_queue.put(command)


The UVM worker thread retrieves this command and invokes uvm_send(genesis_obj, 'display_yourself'). The call fails, as genesis_obj has no display_yourself slot. The uvm_send function then delegates the message to the traits_obj via the parent* slot. This also fails. Having exhausted the delegation chain, the uvm_send function triggers the prime mover, calling uvm_send(genesis_obj, 'doesNotUnderstand:', failed_message_object).

The doesNotUnderstand: method on the traits object now executes. It gathers the necessary context and formulates a precise, structured prompt to be sent to the MockLLM. This prompt is the "question" part of our training data and is the physical embodiment of the "JIT compiler for intent" concept. It translates the low-level computational failure into a high-level semantic request.

3.2 The LLM's Simulated Response: Generating the Entropic UI and Synaptic Bridge

The doesNotUnderstand: handler passes the generated prompt to the MockLLM.generate_code() method. The mock LLM, acting as a perfect oracle, returns a single, unabridged string containing the complete Python code required to fulfill the Architect's intent. This code string is the "answer" part of our training data. It is meticulously crafted to demonstrate the ideal behavior of the UVM LLM, adhering to all system constraints.

The returned string will contain several distinct but interconnected components:

API Covenant (Pydantic & MessagePack): It defines the Pydantic BaseModel classes for every message that can be passed over the Synaptic Bridge, as specified in Table 4. It also includes helper functions that use the ormsgpack library to provide fast, efficient serialization (packb) and deserialization (unpackb) of these Pydantic models, enabling a robust and validated communication protocol.20

Kivy UI Code: It defines the necessary Kivy classes. This includes a UvmClientApp(App) class to run the UI, a WorldMorph(BoxLayout) to serve as the root widget, and a ProtoMorph(Button) widget that can visually represent a backend UvmObject. The UI code will include a TextInput for sending commands and a Button to trigger the send action.21

Synaptic Bridge (ZMQ): It defines the communication logic.

Backend (ROUTER): A function intended to be run in the UVM worker thread. It creates a ZMQ context and a ROUTER socket, binding it to a TCP port (e.g., tcp://*:5555). It then enters a loop, asynchronously receiving multipart messages from the UI.23 The first frame of a received message is the client's identity, which the
ROUTER socket uses to send replies back to the correct client.

Frontend (DEALER): A class or set of functions to be used within the Kivy main thread. It creates a ZMQ context and a DEALER socket, connecting to the backend's address. It sets a unique identity for the UI client (e.g., b'ARCHITECT_UI'). Crucially, to avoid blocking the Kivy event loop, it uses Clock.schedule_interval to call a poll_backend() method periodically (e.g., 60 times per second). This poll method uses a non-blocking socket.recv_multipart(flags=zmq.NOBLOCK) to check for incoming messages from the UVM.1

3.3 In-Memory Integration: The Autopoietic Loop Closes

Upon receiving the code string from the mock LLM, the doesNotUnderstand: handler must integrate this new capability into the running system without saving it to an external file or requiring a restart. This is the final and most critical step in closing the autopoietic loop.1

The integration is achieved using Python's built-in exec() function, a powerful tool for dynamic code execution.25 The handler performs the following sequence:

Prepare Execution Scope: It creates a locals_dict dictionary to serve as the local namespace for the executed code. This dictionary is populated with references to essential modules and objects that the generated code will need, such as the kivy, zmq, threading, and ormsgpack modules, as well as a reference to the UVM's inter-thread command queue.

Dynamic Execution: It calls exec(code_string, {}, locals_dict). This parses and executes the code string, defining all the new Pydantic models, Kivy widget classes, and ZMQ functions within the locals_dict namespace.

Instantiate and Integrate: The handler retrieves the newly defined classes from locals_dict. It then:

Creates an instance of the backend ZMQ router class and starts it in a new daemon thread.

Creates an instance of the Kivy UI application class.

Creates a new UvmObject to act as a ui_manager prototype.

Adds the Kivy app instance and the ZMQ router instance as slots to this ui_manager object.

Persist the Change: The handler uses the system's own message-passing primitive to add the new ui_manager prototype as a slot on the genesis_obj: uvm_send(genesis_obj, 'setSlot:value:', 'ui_manager', ui_manager_instance).

Commit Transaction: transaction.commit() is called. This atomically saves the modified genesis_obj—which now contains a reference to the newly created and fully functional UI system—to the ZODB.

At this moment, the system has successfully modified its own structure and capabilities in-memory and persisted that change, completing its first act of self-production. The main script can then call the run() method on the Kivy app instance, launching the newly created UI.

Table 3: doesNotUnderstand: Generated Prompt Structure

This table defines the structured format of the prompt generated by the doesNotUnderstand: handler, which serves as the contextual input for the LLM.

Table 4: Synaptic Bridge API Covenant (Pydantic Schemas)

This table presents the Pydantic BaseModel definitions that form the verifiable contract for communication across the Synaptic Bridge, as specified in the research material.1

Part IV: The Genesis Dataset: A Canonical Transcript for Fine-Tuning

The final output of the Genesis Script is not the running application itself, but the high-fidelity transcript of its own creation. This transcript, formalized into a structured dataset, will serve as the first and most fundamental lesson for the actual UVM LLM, teaching it the core principles of autopoietic action within its constrained computational environment.

4.1 Dataset Schema and Structure

To be compatible with standard instruction-based fine-tuning pipelines, the generated data must adhere to a consistent schema. Each entry in the Genesis Dataset will be a single JSON object containing three key fields:

instruction: A static, high-level directive that frames the task for the LLM. This tells the model what its general role is in this context. For example: "You are the core intelligence of an autopoietic system. You have received a message that the system does not understand. Your task is to generate the necessary Python components to fulfill the user's inferred intent while strictly adhering to the system's architectural constraints, such as in-memory modification and the prototype object model."

context: The specific, dynamic information related to the task instance. This field will contain the full, structured prompt object generated by the doesNotUnderstand: handler, as defined in Table 3. This provides the model with the "JIT" information it needs to generate a relevant response.

response: The ideal, ground-truth completion. This field will contain the complete, unabridged Python code string returned by the MockLLM, representing the perfect "computational outcome" for the given context.

This schema cleanly separates the general role (instruction), the specific situation (context), and the desired output (response), providing a clear and effective format for supervised fine-tuning.

4.2 The Genesis Transcript: The First Training Example

The execution of the Genesis Script as described in Part III produces exactly one such data record. This single record is the Genesis Transcript. It is the most critical piece of training data the system will ever receive, as it demonstrates the foundational act of creating the very tools (the UI and communication bridge) necessary for all future guided evolution.

This JSON object will contain:

The static instruction string.

The context object, detailing the display_yourself message sent to the genesis_obj, the state of genesis_obj at the time of the message, and the inferred intent to create a UI.

The response string, containing the complete, multi-part Python code for the Pydantic models, the Kivy UI, the ZMQ bridge, and the serialization helpers.

This transcript serves as the definitive, executable example of translating a high-level semantic intent into a valid autopoietic action that expands the system's own capabilities while preserving its organizational closure. It is the "Rosetta Stone" that will teach the UVM LLM how to begin the process of building itself.

Table 5: Genesis Fine-Tuning Data Record Schema

This table provides a clear, machine-readable example of the final JSON object structure that constitutes a single record in the fine-tuning dataset.

Conclusion

The Genesis Script Protocol detailed in this report provides a complete and actionable blueprint for bootstrapping an autopoietic LLM system. It moves beyond theoretical architecture to a concrete implementation plan that addresses the practical challenges of realizing a prototype-based, continuously-running AI in Python. By leveraging a transactional object database (ZODB) for persistence, a custom UvmObject to emulate the Self language paradigm, and a multi-threaded design to integrate a Kivy UI with a ZMQ-based backend, this protocol establishes a robust primordial substrate for the system's existence.

The core contribution of this plan is the method for generating the initial, high-quality fine-tuning dataset. By simulating the system's first creative act—the generation of its own user interface in response to a failed message—we produce a canonical transcript. This "Genesis Dataset" is not merely data; it is a foundational lesson in self-creation, designed to instill the UVM LLM with the specific, constrained logic of its own becoming from its very first training cycle. The successful execution of this protocol will yield a single, perfect data record that serves as the "Rosetta Stone," enabling the LLM to learn how to translate high-level intent into valid, in-memory, self-modifying code. This represents the first and most critical step in the journey from an allopoietic tool to an autopoietic, computationally living entity.

Object | Slot Name | Slot Content Description

traits_obj | ifTrue:ifFalse: | A Python function that implements conditional logic. It expects the receiver to be a boolean prototype and executes the value slot of one of two block prototype arguments.

whileTrue: | A Python function that implements looping. It expects the receiver to be a block that returns a boolean and repeatedly executes a second block argument.

doesNotUnderstand: | A Python function that acts as the prime mover for evolution. It gathers context about a failed message send and invokes the UVM's LLM to generate a solution.

genesis_obj | parent* | A direct object reference to the traits_obj, establishing it as the parent for delegation.

clone | A Python function that creates and returns a new UvmObject containing a shallow copy of the receiver's _slots dictionary. This is the fundamental mechanism for object creation.

setSlot:value: | A Python function that adds a new slot or modifies an existing slot in the receiver's _slots dictionary. This is the core mechanism for runtime specialization and self-modification.

Key | Type | Description

triggering_event | String | A description of the event that initiated the autopoietic loop. E.g., "An object received a message for which no corresponding slot was found after exhausting the delegation chain."

receiver_state | Object | A JSON representation of the receiving UvmObject's _slots dictionary, providing the LLM with the object's current state and capabilities.

failed_message | Object | An object containing the name (String) and arguments (List) of the message that could not be understood.

architect_intent | String | A high-level, natural language interpretation of the goal implied by the failed message. E.g., "The Architect intends to create a visual, interactive user interface to display and interact with the state of the UVM object graph."

constraints | List | A list of non-negotiable architectural rules the generated code must follow. E.g., "All code must be self-contained in a single string," "Generated components must be integrated into the live object graph via slots," "Communication must use a ZMQ ROUTER/DEALER pattern."

Schema Name | Type | Fields | Description

GetFullStateCommand | Command | command: Literal["get_full_state"] | A request sent from the UI to the backend to receive a complete snapshot of the UVM's current state.

UvmStateUpdateEvent | Event | state: Dict[str, Any] | A broadcast event sent from the backend to the UI containing the UVM's complete, MessagePack-serialized state.

UpdatePropertyCommand | Command | command: Literal["update_property"], object_uuid: str, slot_name: str, slot_value: Any | A command sent from the UI to modify a simple data slot on a specific UvmObject.

CreateMethodCommand | Command | command: Literal["create_method"], object_uuid: str, method_name: str, method_code: str | The primary autopoietic primitive. A command from the UI containing the name and Python source code for a new method to be dynamically added to a live UvmObject.

Key | Example Content

instruction | "You are the core intelligence of an autopoietic system... Your task is to generate the necessary Python components to fulfill the user's inferred intent..."
