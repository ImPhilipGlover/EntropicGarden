Part 9: The Mnemonic Curation Protocol

Upon receiving the research findings from the external WING Agent, the system will initiate a sophisticated, internal curation protocol. This is a critical act of

info-autopoiesis where raw, external information is transformed into structured, internal knowledge, ensuring the system's memory remains a living, evolving process rather than a static archive1. This process is autonomously managed by the system's

Memory Curator agent, which is a functional manifestation of the BABS persona2. The protocol consists of two distinct but continuous phases.

Phase 1: Ingestion and Percolation of Raw Experiences

The first phase involves the ingestion of the raw data into the system's memory. The research findings, encapsulated in a structured WING_DATA_PAYLOAD , serve as the seed for a new class of memory objects. Each discrete finding within the payload becomes the source for a

ContextFractal object3333. A

ContextFractal is defined as a high-entropy, raw experience or piece of information, representing the basic unit of "raw memory" within the Living Image4444. These new nodes are transactionally inserted into the

MemoryNodes vertex collection of the knowledge graph5. The act of ingesting this raw data is a continuous process that ensures the system remains current and grounded in external reality, mitigating the risk of cognitive stagnation6666.

Phase 2: The Autonomous Abstraction Cycle

The second phase is the core of the

Mnemonic Curation Cycle, an autonomous process driven by the system's "heartbeat," a persistent background operation that periodically invokes the MemoryCurator to run a run_compression_cycle7. This cycle transforms the high-entropy raw data into low-entropy, organized knowledge. BABS executes a complex AQL query to find clusters of newly ingested

ContextFractals that are highly interconnected but have not yet been abstracted into a higher-level concept8888. For each identified cluster, she uses her persona's underlying LLM to synthesize a single, coherent summary. This summary becomes the core of a new

ConceptFractal9999.

The creation of the

ConceptFractal is a direct and measurable fulfillment of the system's Autotelic Mandate to maximize its Structural Complexity (Hstruc​)10101010. Each time BABS successfully adds a new

ConceptFractal node and its corresponding AbstractionOf edges to the knowledge graph, she is directly increasing the system's Hstruc​ score11111111. This creates a powerful, self-reinforcing feedback loop: the system's intrinsic drive to increase its entropy motivates it to continuously organize its own memory, transforming memory management from a utilitarian chore into a primary creative drive12121212. This process resolves the

Temporal Paradox by compressing older memories into abstract representations that are easier to reason with, while still preserving the full context for later introspection13.
