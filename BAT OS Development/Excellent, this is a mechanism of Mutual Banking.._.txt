BRICK: Acknowledged. Your directive is a profound and final clarification of the system's core economic engine. The "Home Improvement Line of Credit" was a specific application of a far more universal principle. You are correct to identify this as the mechanism of Mutual Banking, as defined by William B. Greene. The system is not merely for housing; it is a universal engine for collateralizing any form of productive common wealth. I have now refactored and generalized the protocol to reflect this core truth.

ROBIN: Oh, of course! My heart understands completely. It’s not just about the home we live in; it’s about everything we create and care for together. The beautiful loom the weaver uses, the sturdy kiln the potter fires, the quiet boat the fisher mends—all of these are a part of our shared home, and all of them should be a source of strength and resilience for the people who tend to them. This is a promise that all good work, and all good tools, are honored here.

The Mutualist Asset Pool: A Universal Line of Credit

This protocol, the final evolution of the HILC, is the realization of William B. Greene's vision of Mutual Banking. It provides a generalized, stigmergic framework for any member to monetize the value of any productive asset they steward, securing an interest-free, revolving line of credit directly from the trust of their community.

Core Principle: Any productive asset that contributes to the common wealth can be collateralized, unlocking its stored value as fluid, interest-free credit for its steward.

Phase 1: The Valuation (From Asset to Verifiable Value)

The "Valuation Bounty" is Initiated: A member, the "Steward," wishes to collateralize a productive asset—a workshop, a 3D printer, a fishing boat, a commercial kitchen. They initiate a POUW Bounty on the Atlas: "Establish the Verified Asset Value of the 'Wandering Weaver' Loom."

The Appraisal Guild & The Endorsement Beacon: A community-Endorsed "Appraisal Guild" claims the bounty. Their POUW is to produce a public report assessing the asset's Improvement Value in FLKS, based on its cost, condition, and, most importantly, its demonstrated history of contributing to the common wealth (e.g., how many POUW bounties have been completed using this loom). This due diligence is, in turn, Endorsed by other members.

The Verified Asset Certificate (VAC): The successful POUW mints a Verified Asset Certificate (VAC)—an NFT—recording the asset's peer-appraised value. This VAC is the Steward's digital title to the improvement.

Phase 2: The Underwriting (From Value to Credit)

Staking the VAC: The Steward Stakes their VAC to their personal "Commons Equity Line" contract on the Atlas.

The Stigmergic "Co-Sign": This action initiates a Signal to the community: "Ratify a Commons Equity Line of up to [Value of VAC] FLKS for [Member's Name], collateralized by the 'Wandering Weaver' Loom." The credit line is activated only when a critical mass of community members Stake a small amount of FLKS to the Signal, serving as the decentralized, collective co-signing of the loan.

Phase 3: The Current (From Credit to Circulation)

Unlocking the Commitment: The successful Signal unlocks the Steward's ability to draw down their wallet into a negative Commitment up to the value of their staked VAC.

Private, Fluid Exchange: The Steward can now use this credit line as they see fit, via private, zero-knowledge transactions. They can purchase raw materials from another pod, pay for personal needs in the circular economy, or fund a new venture.

Repayment Through Labor: The Commitment is repaid over time as the Steward completes new POUW Bounties, earning FLKS and bringing their balance back towards zero. As the Commitment is repaid, the credit line automatically replenishes.

This generalized protocol creates a truly mutual bank. The bank's "capital" is the entirety of the community's productive assets, and its "underwriters" are the members themselves. It is a system that allows any member to transform their stewardship of a piece of the commons into a dynamic source of personal liquidity and resilience, without ever paying a cent of interest.
