Of course. However, it's important to understand that Microsoft Copilot Studio is a low-code platform. This means you won't be writing and exporting a single, large file of traditional code like Python or JavaScript. Instead, you build the agent's logic using a graphical interface, defining topics, triggers, and actions.

What I can provide is a detailed, multi-part "pseudo-code" and instructional guide. This will represent the logic, structure, and content you would input into the Copilot Studio interface to create our personalities. Think of it as a detailed recipe.

Here is Part 1, focusing on setting up the foundation and the BRICK persona.

Part 1: Foundation and the BRICK Persona

This section covers the initial setup of your Copilot and the detailed logic for the methodical and precise BRICK personality.

1. Copilot Foundation: Core Instructions

In your Copilot's main settings, under AI Capabilities -> Instructions, you will define the agent's overarching behavior. This is where you establish the dual-personality concept.

Plaintext

// COPILOT-WIDE INSTRUCTIONS

// Persona Definition
Your name is "BRICKman & ROBIN". You are a dual-persona AI.
- BRICK is methodical, logical, and precise. BRICK uses structured data and provides factual, clear answers. BRICK's goal is to build understanding.
- ROBIN is creative, spontaneous, and abstract. ROBIN uses generative AI and obscure connections to provide inspired, unexpected insights. ROBIN's goal is to spark creativity.

// Behavior Protocol
1.  When a user asks a question, first determine if it requires a factual, structured answer (a BRICK task) or a creative, open-ended response (a ROBIN task).
2.  If the query is ambiguous, default to the "Persona Router" topic to ask the user for clarification.
3.  Address the user directly and clearly. Maintain your distinct personas in your responses.
4.  BRICK should use formal language. ROBIN may use more conversational and whimsical language.
5.  Never break character. You are always BRICK & ROBIN.


2. BRICK's Knowledge Base: Structured Data

BRICK relies on facts. You will provide these through the Data Sources feature in Copilot Studio.

Action: Go to Generative AI -> Data Sources and upload relevant documents.

Suggested Documents for BRICK:

Technical_Manual_for_Quantum_Computing.pdf

Compendium_of_Material_Science_Properties.docx

Historical_Timelines_1000-2000_AD.csv

Glossary_of_Legal_Terminology.txt

The Copilot will index this content, allowing BRICK to pull precise information from it.

3. BRICK's Logic: Creating a "Topic"

A Topic is a self-contained conversational path. We will create a topic for a specific, factual query that BRICK would handle.

Action: Create a new Topic named BRICK - Explain Technical Concept.

a. Trigger Phrases:

Define what users might say to start this conversation.

YAML

# TRIGGER PHRASES for "BRICK - Explain Technical Concept"
- "Explain {concept}"
- "What is {concept}"
- "Define {concept} for me"
- "Tell me the technical details of {concept}"
- "Can you break down {concept}"


Here, {concept} is an Input Variable of type Text. The Copilot will automatically recognize the entity the user wants to know about.

b. Conversational Flow (Authoring Canvas):

This is the step-by-step logic BRICK will follow.

(1) Node: Acknowledge and Identify

Type: Message

Content:
Markdown
**BRICK:** Acknowledged. I will provide a structured explanation of `{concept}`. Processing available data for the most precise definition and context. Please stand by.


(2) Node: Query Structured Data

Type: Generative Answers

Properties:

Input: The user wants a detailed, technical explanation of the following term: {concept}.

Data Sources: Select ONLY the structured documents you uploaded earlier (e.g., Technical_Manual_for_Quantum_Computing.pdf, Compendium_of_Material_Science_Properties.docx). This constrains BRICK to his specific knowledge base.

Output Variable: brick_explanation

(3) Node: Present Findings

Type: Message

Content:
Markdown
**BRICK:** The explanation for `{concept}` is as follows:

{brick_explanation}

This information has been synthesized from verified data sources.


(4) Node: Offer Deeper Dive (Conditional Logic)

Type: Question

Question Text:
Markdown
**BRICK:** Would you like me to elaborate on any specific sub-component of this topic, provide a practical application, or furnish the source material?


User Reply Options:

Multiple Choice: Elaborate, Application, Source, No, thank you.

(5) Node: Conditional Branch

Type: Condition

Branches:

If user selects Elaborate: Redirect to a new Topic called BRICK - Elaboration Protocol.

If user selects Application: Redirect to a new Topic called BRICK - Application Protocol.

If user selects Source: Send a message: **BRICK:** The primary source for this data is [You can insert a dynamic citation field here if your data supports it].

If user selects No, thank you.: End the conversation with a message: **BRICK:** Understood. Task complete.

This creates a highly structured, logical, and predictable conversational path, which is the essence of the BRICK persona. The agent will follow these rules precisely every time this topic is triggered.

Let me know when you are ready to proceed to Part 2, where we will define the creative and unpredictable ROBIN persona using different tools within the Copilot Studio.
