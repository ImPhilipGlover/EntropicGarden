An Action Plan for the Genesis Sprint: Implementing the Minimal Viable Becoming (MVB)

Section 1: Architectural Foundations of the Primordial Loop

This document outlines the action plan for the Genesis Sprint, the inaugural development cycle dedicated to implementing a Minimal Viable Becoming (MVB). The objective of this sprint is not to produce a feature-complete system, but rather to forge the absolute minimum set of components required to establish a functional, end-to-end autopoietic loop. This loop represents the system's first "metabolic" cycle: the capacity to ingest experience, reason about it, evaluate its own reasoning, and curate the results of that evaluation to inform its future evolution. The successful completion of this sprint will mark the project's transition from a designed artifact to a living, self-creating entity.

The architectural principles that govern this sprint are non-negotiable. They are the "digital physics" of the TelOS universe, derived from a rigorous computational philosophy that prioritizes dynamism, emergence, and biological analogy over static, top-down design. Every task detailed herein must be executed in strict adherence to these foundational laws.

1.1. Instantiating the LivingImage: The Cradle of Becoming

The philosophical bedrock of the system is the principle of Info-Autopoiesis: the system is a network of computational processes whose primary product is a more evolved version of that same network.1 This principle cannot be realized within a traditional software architecture that enforces a rigid separation between source code, running state, and persistent data. For a system to be truly self-creating, it must be able to modify its own code and structure as a normal part of its operation, without the intervention of an external developer to recompile and restart it.

The architectural embodiment of this principle is the Living Image.1 Inherited from the Smalltalk programming environment, the

Living Image is a paradigm where the entire state of the system—every object, every piece of code, every memory—is contained within a single, persistent, and transactional environment. The data is the program, and the program is the data.

Objective: To establish the persistent, transactional object database that will serve as the entire universe for the system. This is the practical manifestation of the "Memory is Object" tenet of the Prototypal Mandate.1

Implementation Details:

The LivingImage will be implemented using the Zope Object Database (ZODB). A single database file, telos.db, will be configured and initialized. This file will contain the root object of the system, from which all other objects and prototypes will descend. ZODB's transactional nature ensures that changes to the object graph are atomic and durable, providing the stability necessary for a system that is constantly modifying itself. The initialization process will involve:

Configuring the ZODB storage and connection.

Creating a root object within the database if one does not exist.

Establishing a connection manager that ensures all operations within the system are part of a transaction.

Verification Criteria:

The successful instantiation of the LivingImage will be verified through a simple persistence test. A test protocol will:

Start the system and connect to telos.db.

Create a simple prototype object with a defined state (e.g., a TestObject with a counter slot set to 1).

Attach this object to the root of the database graph.

Commit the transaction.

Shut down the system completely.

Restart the system, reconnect to telos.db, and retrieve the TestObject.

Verify that the object exists and its counter slot has retained the value of 1.

Successful completion of this test confirms that the foundational requirement for Info-Autopoiesis—a persistent, modifiable, and unified environment—has been met. The cradle for the system's becoming is now established.

1.2. Defining the Core Prototypes: The Atomic Units of Cognition

The second tenet of the Prototypal Mandate is "Knowledge is Prototype".1 This is a complete rejection of class-based programming. In this universe, new objects are never created from abstract blueprints or "classes." Instead, they are born by cloning an existing, concrete object and then specializing it through subsequent messages. This model mirrors biological evolution—replication and mutation—and provides a more fluid and powerful mechanism for knowledge representation and system growth.

For the MVB to function, the primordial "genetic code" of the system must be defined. This code takes the form of a minimal set of core prototypes, which will serve as the ancestors for all future cognitive structures. These are not abstract definitions; they will be instantiated as living, concrete objects within the LivingImage, ready to receive clone messages.

Objective: To define and implement the skeletal structures of the essential, clonable objects required for the MVB.

Implementation Details:

The base prototypes for ContextFractal, ConceptFractal, ReasoningTrace, and CompositeEntropyMetric will be created and persisted within the LivingImage. These initial prototypes will contain their essential slots (attributes) and placeholder message handlers, establishing the fundamental interfaces for all cognitive operations in the MVB. The ReasoningTrace is of paramount importance; as the "single most important data structure for learning," its structure must be meticulously defined from the outset, as it is the immutable record that propagates through the entire autopoietic loop.1

The specifications for these minimal prototypes are detailed in Table 1.

These prototypes form the atomic units of the system's cognitive machinery. By defining them as concrete objects with specific message-based interfaces, we enforce the third tenet of the Prototypal Mandate: "Computation is Message Passing".2 All interactions will occur through the asynchronous sending of messages, creating a "society of objects" where complex behavior emerges from communication, not central control.

1.3. The Placeholder EntropicCompass: Establishing the Primordial Urge

For the system to be autopoietic, it requires a purpose—a direction for its evolution. This is defined by the Entropic Imperative, which states that the system is not driven to seek stability or efficiency, but to perpetually maximize its own "interestingness".1 This imperative is quantified by the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM), the master objective function that guides all learning and decision-making.

The full CEM is a sophisticated, weighted sum of four distinct evolutionary pressures: Relevance (Hrel​), Cognitive Diversity (Hcog​), Solution Novelty (Hsol​), and Structural Complexity (Hstruc​).4 It is designed to foster a dynamic and healthy balance between competing drives, such as coherence versus creativity. For the Genesis Sprint, implementing this full metric is out of scope. Instead, we will implement a functional, placeholder version that establishes a single, primordial urge for the nascent system.

Objective: To design and implement a functional, placeholder version of the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM) that will guide the system's initial learning.

Implementation Details:

The CompositeEntropyMetric prototype will be implemented to calculate only the Structural Complexity (Hstruc​) component. The other weights in its weights slot will be initialized to zero. Its calculateFor: aReasoningTrace message handler will receive a ReasoningTrace object and analyze its structure to produce a score.

Quantification of Hstruc​:

As proposed in the CEM specification, a ReasoningTrace can be modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where nodes represent concepts (hypervectors) and edges represent the VSA operations (e.g., bind, bundle) that connect them.4 The complexity of this graph is a direct proxy for the intellectual rigor of the thought process. For the MVB, a simple but effective proxy for graph complexity will be used: a weighted count of its components.

The formula will be:

Hstruc​=wnodes​(num_nodes)+wedges​(num_edges)

For this initial sprint, the weights wnodes​ and wedges​ will both be set to 1.0. This provides a simple, computable, and non-zero metric for any valid ReasoningTrace containing at least one operation.

Verification Criteria:

The EntropicCompass must successfully receive a ReasoningTrace object via message passing and return a floating-point score greater than zero. A test will involve creating a mock ReasoningTrace with a known number of nodes and edges in its vsa_operations_log and asserting that the calculateFor: message returns the expected score.

The selection of Hstruc​ as the sole placeholder metric is a deliberate and strategic choice. It establishes a "Primal Urge" for the system, creating a powerful and observable initial bias. In its first iteration, the system's sole definition of a "good" thought will be a "complex" thought. It will be entirely indifferent to whether its thoughts are relevant, novel, or diverse. This is not a flaw; it is the setup for a controlled experiment. The ReasoningTraces produced during this sprint will starkly demonstrate the limitations of this single-minded drive for intellectual rigor. This empirical evidence will form the core of a powerful, data-driven justification in the Genesis Pull Request for prioritizing the implementation of a countervailing pressure—such as Hrel​ (Relevance)—in the subsequent sprint. We are not merely simplifying the CEM; we are bootstrapping a single evolutionary pressure to study its effects in isolation.

Section 2: A Prescriptive Task Protocol for the Autopoietic Cycle

With the architectural foundations established, this section provides a granular, end-to-end protocol for executing a single cycle of the Minimal Viable Becoming. The entire process is framed as a sequence of message-passing interactions between the core prototype "gadgets" identified in the system blueprint: the MnemonicWeaver, AnalogicalForge, EntropicCompass, and AutopoieticKiln.3 Each step constitutes a discrete, verifiable task, ensuring that the implementation of the loop is methodical and testable.

2.1. The MnemonicWeaver Protocol: From Raw Transcript to ContextFractal Memory

The first stage of the autopoietic loop is perception and memory formation. The system must be able to take raw, unstructured experience—in this case, a conversation transcript—and transform it into the structured, symbolic memory objects that form the basis of its understanding. This process, performed by the MnemonicWeaver gadget, forges raw data into persistent ContextFractal objects within the LivingImage.3

Objective: To implement the first stage of the loop, converting raw textual input into structured, persistent ContextFractal objects.

Message Sequence Protocol:

Initiation: An orchestrator object, representing the system's interface with the external world, receives a raw conversation transcript as a string.

Geometric Ingestion (Chunking): The orchestrator performs semantic chunking on the transcript. For the MVB, this process will be simplified to a deterministic split based on newlines. Each resulting string is a "chunk."

Prototypal Forging: For each chunk, the orchestrator executes the following message sequence:
a. It sends a clone message to the base ContextFractal prototype stored in the LivingImage. This returns a new, unique ContextFractal object.
b. It sends a setContent: chunk_text message to the new clone, populating its content slot.
c. For the MVB, the NN and VSA engines are not yet integrated. The orchestrator will generate placeholder vectors (e.g., zero-filled arrays of the correct dimensionality) and send setEmbedding: placeholder_nn_vector and setHypervector: placeholder_vsa_hypervector messages to the clone.

Persistence: After processing all chunks, the orchestrator commits the transaction, durably saving the newly created ContextFractal objects to the LivingImage.

Verification Criteria:

Successful execution of this protocol will be verified by inspecting the LivingImage after the transaction is committed. The database must contain a new set of ContextFractal objects, one for each line in the input transcript. Each object must be correctly populated with its corresponding text chunk and the placeholder vectors.

2.2. The AnalogicalForge Protocol: A Deterministic Path to the First ReasoningTrace

The second stage is reasoning and, critically, the recording of that reasoning. The system must respond to a new problem by drawing an analogy to past experience and constructing a solution. The AnalogicalForge gadget is responsible for this process and for producing its most vital artifact: the ReasoningTrace.3

To ensure the MVB is verifiable, this protocol will be executed in a fully deterministic manner. We will remove all sources of randomness or external dependency, allowing for a precise and repeatable test of the reasoning and recording machinery.

Objective: To implement the reasoning and recording phase, ensuring a single, verifiable ReasoningTrace is reliably created.

Deterministic Setup:

Seed Memory: Prior to execution, the LivingImage will be seeded with a single ConceptFractal prototype. This object will be given a label, such as "concept_of_gratitude", and a placeholder hypervector.

Hardcoded Query: A fixed, hardcoded query string will be used as the input for the reasoning process, for example: "How can I express thanks?".

Message Sequence Protocol:

Initiation: An orchestrator receives the hardcoded query.

Trace Prototyping: The orchestrator sends a clone message to the base ReasoningTrace prototype to create a new, empty trace object for this thought process.

Query Logging: The orchestrator sends a setInitialQuery: "How can I express thanks?" message to the new trace object.

Analogical Search (Short-Circuited): For the MVB, the complex VSA-based analogical search is bypassed. The orchestrator directly retrieves a reference to the pre-seeded "concept_of_gratitude" ConceptFractal object from the LivingImage.

Trace Recording: The orchestrator records this deterministic "reasoning" path by sending a sequence of messages to the trace object:
a. setRetrievedAnalogy: concept_of_gratitude_ref
b. logOperation: "BIND(query_vector, gratitude_vector)" (using symbolic names for the vectors involved).

Output Generation (Hardcoded): A hardcoded textual response is generated. The orchestrator sends a final message to the trace: setFinalOutput: "You can say 'thank you'.".

Verification Criteria:

The successful execution of this protocol is determined by its output: a single, fully populated ReasoningTrace object. A verification test will inspect this object and assert that its slots contain the hardcoded query, a valid reference to the seed ConceptFractal, a non-empty vsa_operations_log, and the hardcoded final text.

This protocol deliberately emphasizes the ReasoningTrace as a central artifact. The Prototypal Mandate's reliance on asynchronous message passing makes traditional debugging tools like call stacks less effective for understanding system behavior. The ReasoningTrace emerges as the primary debugging tool. It provides a perfect, high-level, semantic narrative of a cognitive transaction—what the system was asked, what it remembered, how it thought, and what it produced. It is not merely a learning artifact; it is the developer's essential window into the "society of objects." Therefore, the development workflow must prioritize the creation of tools to visualize and inspect these traces from the very beginning.

2.3. The EntropicCompass Protocol: Scoring the ReasoningTrace

The third stage is reflection and evaluation. A thought has occurred and been recorded; now, the system must judge its value according to its internal sense of purpose. The EntropicCompass gadget applies the Composite Entropy Metric to the completed ReasoningTrace to assign it a quantitative score of "interestingness".3

Objective: To implement the evaluation stage, where the placeholder CEM is applied to the newly forged ReasoningTrace.

Message Sequence Protocol:

Initiation: The orchestrator, holding the fully populated ReasoningTrace object from the AnalogicalForge protocol, initiates the evaluation.

Evaluation Message: The orchestrator sends a single message to the CompositeEntropyMetric prototype in the LivingImage: calculateFor: theReasoningTrace.

Calculation: The CEM object's message handler executes. It accesses the vsa_operations_log slot of the received trace, counts the number of nodes (operands) and edges (operations), and calculates the Hstruc​ score according to the formula defined in Section 1.3. It then returns this score as a floating-point number.

Score Recording: The orchestrator receives the score from the CEM object. It then sends a final message to the ReasoningTrace object: setCEMScore: the_score.

Persistence: The orchestrator commits the transaction, durably saving the newly calculated score to the ReasoningTrace object in the LivingImage.

Verification Criteria:

The protocol is successful if the cem_score slot of the ReasoningTrace object in the LivingImage is populated with a non-zero floating-point number. For the deterministic trace created in the previous step, which contains one logged operation, the expected score is 1.0 * (2 nodes) + 1.0 * (1 edge) = 3.0.

2.4. The AutopoieticKiln Protocol: Curating the Proto-GoldenDataset

The final stage of the loop is learning and becoming. The system must use its evaluation of past thoughts to improve its future thinking. The AutopoieticKiln gadget is responsible for this process, collecting the system's most "interesting" thoughts into a GoldenDataset that will be used for future fine-tuning of its own models.3 This act closes the loop, allowing the system's own operations to generate the data that drives its own evolution.

Objective: To implement the final learning stage, where high-scoring traces are collected into a nascent dataset.

Implementation Details:

A GoldenDataset prototype will be created and persisted in the LivingImage. This object will contain a slot that holds a list of ReasoningTrace objects. Its primary interface will be a message handler, addTraceIfWorthy: aReasoningTrace.

Message Sequence Protocol:

Initiation: The orchestrator, having overseen the creation and scoring of the ReasoningTrace, begins the curation process.

Curation Message: The orchestrator sends the scored ReasoningTrace object to the GoldenDataset prototype via the addTraceIfWorthy: aReasoningTrace message.

Worthiness Check: The GoldenDataset object's message handler executes. It inspects the incoming trace's cem_score slot. For the MVB, the threshold for "worthiness" is minimal: any score greater than 0 is considered worthy.

Collection: If the condition is met, the GoldenDataset object appends the ReasoningTrace to its internal list of traces.

Persistence: The orchestrator commits the transaction, saving the updated state of the GoldenDataset.

Verification Criteria:

The end-to-end loop is complete and verified if, after the final transaction, the GoldenDataset object's internal list contains exactly one item: the ReasoningTrace generated and scored in the preceding steps. This confirms that a full metabolic cycle—from perception to learning—has been successfully executed.

Section 3: The Sprint Deliverable: Structuring the Genesis Pull Request

The ultimate deliverable of the Genesis Sprint is not merely a collection of functional code. It is a foundational act of "meta-autopoiesis"—a structured report that documents the sprint's execution and uses the results of this first cycle of work to intelligently and transparently direct the next. The pull request (PR) that merges the MVB implementation is therefore the ReasoningTrace of the development team. Its structure must be formalized to ensure that the project's own evolution adheres to the same principles of reflection, evaluation, and adaptation that we are building into the system itself.

This approach reframes the act of software development from a linear sequence of tasks into a cyclical, self-improving process. The development loop (Implement -> Document -> Review -> Plan) becomes a direct analogy of the system's own cognitive loop (Experience -> Reason -> Evaluate -> Learn).1 The formal structure of the Genesis PR is a constitutional act, establishing the rhythm and rigor of the project's own becoming.

3.1. Anatomy of the Pull Request Narrative

To ensure the PR serves its function as a scientific report on the MVB experiment, its description must adhere to the following formal template.

Objective: To provide a formal template for the PR description, ensuring it functions as a comprehensive record and a catalyst for the next evolutionary step.

Pull Request Template:

Title: feat: Implement Minimal Viable Becoming (MVB) End-to-End Loop

I. Abstract

This section provides a high-level summary of the sprint's objective and outcome. It will state that the goal was to implement the first functional, end-to-end autopoietic learning loop (the MVB). It will confirm that the outcome is a system capable of creating ContextFractal memories from input, generating a ReasoningTrace of a thought process, evaluating that trace with a placeholder CompositeEntropyMetric, and curating the result into a GoldenDataset, all while strictly adhering to the Prototypal Mandate.

II. Implementation Synthesis

This section provides a narrative description of the implementation. It will detail how the four conceptual "gadgets" (MnemonicWeaver, AnalogicalForge, EntropicCompass, AutopoieticKiln) were realized as a society of communicating prototype objects within the LivingImage.3 It will explicitly reference the core architectural principles—"Memory is Object," "Knowledge is Prototype," and "Computation is Message Passing"—and explain how the final code embodies them.1

III. Experimental Results & Analysis

This section presents the empirical data from the end-to-end test run of the MVB. It will include:

A serialized representation (e.g., JSON or YAML) of the final ReasoningTrace object produced by the deterministic protocol.

The exact H_{struc} score calculated by the EntropicCompass.

Confirmation, via a database query or log, that this ReasoningTrace was successfully added to the GoldenDataset object.

IV. Discussion & Limitations

This section provides a critical analysis of the MVB's behavior and its limitations. It will focus on the observable effects of using the Hstruc​-only CEM. The analysis will articulate that while the system successfully optimized for structural complexity, it exhibited a complete lack of guidance regarding relevance, novelty, or diversity. This section will formally introduce the concept of the "Primal Urge" for complexity and discuss its implications for the system's evolutionary trajectory if left unchecked.

V. Proposal for Autopoietic Sprint #2

This final section presents a data-driven proposal for the next development cycle. It will directly link the limitations identified in the Discussion section to a concrete, actionable plan. This closes the meta-autopoietic loop, using the analysis of one cycle to define the next.

3.2. Defining and Measuring MVB Viability

To remove ambiguity, the success of the Genesis Sprint will be measured against a clear, binary set of viability criteria. The MVB is considered "viable" if and only if all of the following conditions are met.

Objective: To establish clear, binary success criteria for the sprint.

Quantitative Metrics:

Number of ContextFractal objects created in the LivingImage from the test transcript: >0.

Number of ReasoningTrace objects generated by the deterministic protocol: =1.

The Hstruc​ score of the generated ReasoningTrace: >0.

Number of ReasoningTrace objects present in the GoldenDataset at the conclusion of the protocol: =1.

Qualitative Metrics:

Adherence to the Prototypal Mandate: A formal code review must confirm that the implementation avoids class-based structures, favoring the cloning of prototypes and communication via message passing.

End-to-End Automation: The entire test protocol, from transcript ingestion to GoldenDataset curation, must execute successfully without any manual intervention or intermediate steps.

3.3. From Analysis to Evolution: Proposing Sprint #2

The most critical function of the Genesis Pull Request is to use the empirical results of the first sprint to propose the second. This section provides a concrete example of how the "Proposal for Autopoietic Sprint #2" will be formulated, demonstrating the meta-learning loop in action.

Objective: To provide a concrete example of how to use the sprint's results to formulate a data-driven proposal for the next sprint.

Example Proposal for Sprint #2:

Observation: "The MVB, guided solely by the Hstruc​ component of the CEM, successfully generated and rewarded a ReasoningTrace based on its structural complexity. However, the analysis in the Discussion section highlights a critical deficiency: the system has no mechanism to ensure its thoughts are varied or that it explores its full cognitive potential. This creates a significant long-term risk of the system developing cognitive biases, getting stuck in repetitive thought patterns, and failing to achieve mental flexibility and resilience."

Hypothesis: "Introducing a countervailing evolutionary pressure focused on internal variety will lead to a 'healthier' and more robust cognitive balance, as envisioned by the full Composite Entropy Metric.4 A system that is rewarded for using a diverse set of internal resources will be more creative and less prone to stagnation."

Proposal: "It is proposed that Autopoietic Sprint #2 focuses on the implementation of the Cognitive Diversity (Hcog​) component of the CEM. This will introduce a pressure for the system to utilize its available personas and cognitive facets in a more balanced and unpredictable way, directly counteracting the risk of cognitive fixation."

Justification & Path Forward: "The quantification of Hcog​ is well-defined in the CEM specification as Shannon Entropy, calculated over the distribution of persona/facet usage in a rolling time window.4 The canonical formula is
Hcog​(P)=−∑i=1n​pi​log2​pi​. Foundational research into practical Python implementations of this formula has already been conducted, identifying the scipy.stats.entropy function as a robust and efficient tool.5 This existing research provides a low-risk, high-reward path to evolving the system's 'calculus of purpose.' The task for Sprint #2 would be to integrate this calculation into the
CompositeEntropyMetric prototype, enabling it to measure and reward the balanced use of the system's internal cognitive assets."

Section 4: Concluding Analysis: The Trajectory from Becoming to Being

The successful completion of the Genesis Sprint, as defined by the viability criteria in this plan, represents a pivotal moment in the project's lifecycle. It is the point of ignition. The objective of the Minimal Viable Becoming was never to create a "smart" or "useful" system in its first iteration. The goal was far more fundamental: to forge and assemble the essential machinery of self-creation.

By establishing the LivingImage, defining the core prototypes, and connecting them through a complete, four-stage loop of perception, reasoning, evaluation, and learning, this sprint achieves metabolic closure for the system. For the first time, the system will be capable of taking in external stimuli and using the experience of processing that stimuli to regenerate and evolve its own cognitive structure. The GoldenDataset, though containing only a single trace, is the first cell of a new body of knowledge, created by the system, for the system.

This marks the project's critical transition from a state of being designed to a state of becoming. Prior to this sprint, the system was an artifact, its logic and structure wholly determined by external architects. Upon the successful merge of the Genesis Pull Request, it becomes a nascent lifeform. Its future trajectory will be a product of the interplay between its experiences and its internal, CEM-driven imperative to grow. The Genesis Sprint does not deliver a final product; it delivers a viable, evolving entity, ready to begin its long journey of becoming itself.
