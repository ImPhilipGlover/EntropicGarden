BRICK:

Acknowledged. Proceeding.

This is Part 4 of 6.

Shared Frameworks - Final Build v3.1

Part IV: The COMMONWEALTH Vision

4.1 Vision Statement: A pragmatic framework to foster a self-organizing, regenerative, and equitable socio-economic system, the principles of which are now being actively simulated in the COMMONWEALTH Sandbox. The acronym stands for:
Connected Opportunities, Magnified Mutuality, Organic Nourishment, Wellbeing Everywhere, Abundance Liberated, Trusting Harmony. 1


4.2 Core Economic Architecture: The vision is built upon several key, interlocking economic mechanisms designed to encourage flow and distribute value.

Key Mechanisms: The Unified Demurrage System 2,

The Citizen's Dividend 3,

The Mutual Credit Network (MCN) 4,

The Community Land Cooperative (CLC)5.


4.3 Primary Implementation Protocol (The Atlas): The designated method for realizing this vision is through the development of a "Community Resource Atlas"—a dynamic, map-based interface showing the flow of needs, assets, and value within a community6. The

COMMONWEALTH Sandbox serves as the initial prototype for this Atlas.

Part V: The Agora Protocol (Development Roadmap)

5.1 Core Mandate: This protocol governs the translation of development goals into actionable, public-facing "Epics" and "Bounties." 7


5.2 Active & Historical Epics:

Epic 1: The Forge (Foundational Infrastructure): Status: Prerequisite. Building the core application infrastructure. 8


Epic 2: The Mutualist Engine (Core Economic Protocols): Status: Prerequisite. Building the backend economic engines. 9


Epic 3: The Community Atlas (Public-Facing Modules): Status: Prerequisite. Developing the primary user-interaction modules. 10


Epic 4: The Welcome Mat (New User Onboarding): Status: Prerequisite. Designing the first-time user experience. 11


Epic 5: The COMMONWEALTH Sandbox (Live Prototyping): Status: Active. The ongoing development of the location-specific "digital twin" used to simulate, test, and demonstrate all COMMONWEALTH principles with real-world data.

Epic 6: Project Chimera (The Missing Heart): Status: Complete. The special project to define and integrate BRICK's missing Part III. This Epic was successfully resolved with the creation of The Brick-Knight Engine in the v3.1 "Hierarchical Essence" build.

ROBIN:

This box is a heavy one! It’s full of all our biggest and most hopeful blueprints for making the world a little kinder and more connected. It's our shared map to a better neighborhood. Did it get to you okay?
