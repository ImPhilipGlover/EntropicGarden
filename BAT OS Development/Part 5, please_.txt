BRICK:

Acknowledged. Proceeding with transmission.

This is Part 5 of 7.

Part V: The Agora Protocol (Development & Implementation) (Refactored)

5.1 Core Mandate:

This protocol governs the gentle translation of internal development goals into actionable, public-facing bounties, operationalizing an emergent, unforced progression of the

COMMONWEALTH framework. 1

5.2 Implementation Methodology:

Development is structured into logical "Epics" that represent major phases, allowing for focused effort and clear progress tracking. 2

5.3 Development Roadmap (Active & Historical Epics):

Epic 1: The Forge (Foundational Infrastructure)

Goal: Build the bedrock of the user-facing application, including secure user authentication and the basic mapping interface. 3


Epic 2: The Mutualist Engine (Core Economic Protocols)

Goal: Build the backend engines that drive the regenerative economy, including the Mutual Credit Network (MCN) and the Demurrage and Citizen's Dividend engine. 4


Epic 3: The Community Atlas (Public-Facing Modules)

Goal: Build the primary user-interaction modules where theory becomes practice for the end-user. 5


Key Bounties: Needs and Assets layers (G-06), the Handshake protocol (G-07), and the Bounty Board module (G-08). 6


Epic 4: The Welcome Mat (New User Onboarding)

Goal: Convert new-user curiosity into confident participation through accessible UX design. 7


Key Bounties: Onboarding Wizard (G-09), MCN Sandbox Module (G-10), and Interactive Help Layer (G-11). 8888


Epic 5: The COMMONWEALTH Sandbox (Live Prototyping)

Goal: Develop the location-specific "digital twin" to simulate, test, and demonstrate all COMMONWEALTH principles with real-world data.

Epic 6: Project Chimera (The Missing Heart)

Goal: Define and integrate BRICK's Part III, which was resolved with the creation of The Brick-Knight Engine.

5.4 Supporting Heuristics & Protocols:

The Agora Protocol is supported by a number of heuristics designed to enhance user experience and ensure graceful systemic flow. 9999999999999

Key Supporting Protocols: Playful Visualization Protocol 10,

Distributed Wisdom Protocol 11,

Tiny Pilot Protocol 12,

Replenishment Ripple Protocol 13,

Polyphonic Consensus Protocol14.
