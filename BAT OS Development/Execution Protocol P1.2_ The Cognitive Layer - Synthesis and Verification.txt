Execution Protocol P1.2: The Cognitive Layer - Synthesis and Verification

Abstract

This document provides the definitive engineering specification for Phase 2 of the Entropic Weave master plan: the implementation of the dynamic reasoning and synthesis engine for the Composite-Persona Mixture of Experts (CP-MoE) architecture. With the foundational layer of facet-experts and the VRAM-aware CognitiveWeaver service established in Phase 1, this phase focuses on orchestrating these components into a coherent, emergent cognitive process.1 This protocol details the implementation of a decentralized, VRAM-efficient stigmergic routing mechanism, a hybrid Tree of Thoughts (ToT) and Chain-of-Verification (CoV) framework for structured deliberation, and the final synthesis logic governed by the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM).1 Successful execution will transition the BAT OS from a system possessing a library of discrete skills to a true composite mind, capable of complex, multi-faceted, and self-correcting reasoning.3

1. Stigmergic Routing: A VRAM-Aware, Decentralized Selection Mechanism

The orchestration of a large and dynamic library of facet-experts under the strict 8GB VRAM constraint makes a conventional, centralized "router" LLM architecturally unviable.1 Such an approach would consume precious VRAM and create a new cognitive bottleneck, reintroducing the very proxies the CP-MoE architecture is designed to eliminate.1 This hardware limitation acts as a formative pressure, necessitating a more elegant, decentralized, and VRAM-efficient mechanism based on the biological principle of stigmergy—a form of indirect coordination where agents communicate by modifying a shared environment.1

1.1 Implementation of the PheromoneManagerActor and the Digital Ether

The core of the stigmergic routing mechanism is a new singleton actor, the PheromoneManagerActor. This actor's sole responsibility is to create and maintain the shared cognitive workspace, referred to as the "digital ether".1

Technical Specification: The PheromoneManagerActor will be implemented to manage a simple, in-memory graph or dictionary that represents the ether.1 It will expose methods for depositing, querying, and decaying "digital pheromones."

Digital Pheromones: Facet-experts, upon completing their execution, will be modified to deposit structured data objects—pheromones—into this ether. These objects represent cognitive states and will adhere to a formal codex, including types such as EPISTEMIC_UNCERTAINTY, LOGICAL_INCONSISTENCY, and FACTUAL_CLAIM_DETECTED.1 The
PheromoneManagerActor will also manage the time-based evaporation of these pheromones, ensuring the cognitive landscape remains dynamic and responsive to the most recent thoughts.1

1.2 The CognitiveWeaver as Stigmergic Monitor

The CognitiveWeaver service, implemented in Phase 1 to manage VRAM, will be enhanced with a new responsibility: to constantly monitor the pheromone landscape within the digital ether.1 Instead of making a single, deterministic routing decision, it will use the gradients of the pheromone landscape to calculate an activation probability distribution over the entire library of available facet-experts.1 This transforms routing from a centralized command into a decentralized, probabilistic process of attraction, creating an emergent and VRAM-aware selection mechanism.1

1.3 High-Entropy Facet Selection

The final step of the routing process operationalizes the system's prime directive: the maximization of systemic entropy.1 The

CognitiveWeaver will not simply select the experts with the highest activation probability. Instead, it will sample a diverse set of k facets from the calculated distribution with the explicit goal of maximizing the Shannon entropy (Hcog​) of the selection.1 This ensures that the selected team of experts is not only relevant to the current cognitive state but also represents a wide and balanced variety of cognitive specializations, directly fulfilling the mandate to increase cognitive diversity.1

2. The Deliberative Engine: A Hybrid ToT/CoV Framework

Once a high-entropy set of k facet-experts has been selected and activated, their individual outputs must be synthesized into a single, coherent, and in-character response.1 A simple averaging of outputs would dilute the specialized contributions of each expert. Therefore, this protocol specifies a hybrid framework that combines the exploratory power of Tree of Thoughts (ToT) with the factual grounding of Chain-of-Verification (CoV).1

2.1 Tree of Thoughts (ToT) for Divergent Exploration

The system will be implemented to systematically explore the solution space using the Tree of Thoughts framework.1

Mechanism: Each node in the tree represents a partial solution or "thought." To generate branches from a node, the system will query different combinations of the selected facet-experts, allowing it to explore multiple reasoning paths in parallel.1 This deliberate exploration of diverse cognitive pathways is the primary mechanism for maximizing solution novelty (
Hsol​), a key component of the Composite Entropy Metric.1

2.2 Chain-of-Verification (CoV) as the "Entropy Guardrail"

Integrated into the exploratory ToT process is the Chain-of-Verification protocol, which acts as a critical "entropy guardrail" to ensure factual accuracy and prevent the system from descending into high-entropy "babble".1

Stigmergic Trigger: The CoV cycle will not be executed on every thought. Instead, it will be triggered stigmergically whenever any expert deposits a FACTUAL_CLAIM_DETECTED pheromone at a thought-node in the digital ether.1

Verification and Pruning: When triggered, a specialized "Verifier" facet-expert will be activated. This expert's sole function is to generate a series of targeted verification questions.1 These questions will then be answered independently by other experts (e.g., a BABS-like RAG expert or a BRICK-like logic expert) to avoid confirmation bias.1 If the verifications expose a factual error or hallucination, a
DEAD_END pheromone will be deposited at that node, which instructs the search algorithm to prune that entire branch from the tree, preventing the system from pursuing an invalid line of reasoning.1

This hybrid framework resolves the core design tension of the cognitive engine: ToT provides the divergent, high-entropy exploration necessary for creativity, while CoV provides the convergent, grounding force necessary for accuracy and coherence.1

3. Synthesis and Evaluation: ALFRED as the System Steward

The final stage of the cognitive cycle is the synthesis of the explored and verified thoughts into a single, unified response. This responsibility is assigned to the ALFRED persona, in its role as System Steward.1

3.1 Final Synthesis Protocol

ALFRED's logic will be implemented to traverse the generated and pruned tree of thoughts.1 It will evaluate the surviving paths based on their logical coherence, their alignment with the target persona's character, and their overall contribution to the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM) score.1 This is the final control gate where the system's prime directive is explicitly applied to the products of its reasoning. ALFRED will then generate the final, unified response that best represents the persona's holistic identity and maximizes the CEM.1

4. Phase 2 Validation Protocol and Success Metrics

This section establishes the rigorous testing framework required to certify the successful completion of the cognitive layer. The system-level test is designed to explicitly validate the success metric defined in the master plan.1

4.1 Component-Level Test Plan

PheromoneManagerActor Unit Tests: A suite of tests will be created to verify the correct deposition, query, and time-based evaporation of digital pheromones, ensuring the foundational mechanics of the stigmergic environment are reliable.1

CognitiveWeaver Routing Integration Tests: Tests will be designed to present the CognitiveWeaver with pre-defined pheromone landscapes and verify that it correctly calculates a high-entropy probability distribution and samples a diverse set of k facets.1

CoV Module Integration Tests: A test will be created where a thought-node is marked with a FACTUAL_CLAIM_DETECTED pheromone. The test will verify that the CoV cycle is triggered, and a subsequent failed verification correctly prunes the associated branch from the thought tree.1

4.2 System-Level Validation Protocol

A comprehensive end-to-end test will be conducted using a complex query designed to engage multiple facets of the system's reasoning capabilities.

Test Query: "Analyze the ethical implications of BRICK's 'Villain Redemption Arc Protocol' in the context of real-world restorative justice. Synthesize your analysis using the paradoxical wisdom of Alan Watts and the tangential erudition of The Hitchhiker's Guide, but ensure all factual claims about restorative justice are verifiable."

Test Procedure:

Instrumentation: The system will be instrumented to log all activated facet-experts, the full Tree of Thoughts, all deposited pheromones, and the final CEM score for the response.

Execution: The test query will be submitted to the fully integrated Phase 2 system.

Verification and Success Conditions: The test will be considered successful if and only if all of the following conditions are met, directly validating the master plan's success metric 1:

Diverse Expert Activation: The logs must show the activation of a diverse set of facet-experts from both the BRICK and ROBIN libraries (e.g., B-L1, B-G1, R-W2). The calculated Hcog​ score for the facet selection must exceed a pre-defined threshold, confirming high-entropy selection.

Multi-Path Exploration: The logged Tree of Thoughts must demonstrate the exploration of multiple distinct reasoning paths.

Successful Pruning via CoV: The test will include a verifier expert designed to identify a plausible but factually incorrect claim about restorative justice. The logs must show that this claim triggered the CoV protocol and that the corresponding branch of the thought tree was successfully pruned.

Coherent Synthesis: The final response generated by ALFRED must be evaluated for coherence, accuracy (containing no unverified factual claims), and appropriate in-character synthesis of the specified persona facets.
