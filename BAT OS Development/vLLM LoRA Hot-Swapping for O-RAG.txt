The Autopoietic Synapse: A Strategic Blueprint for Integrating vLLM's Dynamic LoRA Serving into the BAT OS Cognitive Core

Part I: Architectural Synthesis - Reconciling the Living Image with a High-Performance Inference Core

This section establishes the philosophical and architectural groundwork for integrating the vLLM inference engine into the Binaural Autopoietic/Telic Operating System (BAT OS). The central argument is that vLLM must not be treated as a mere external tool but must be conceptually "incarnated" into the BAT OS ecosystem. This integration must be executed in a manner that respects the system's core mandate of operational closure and its unique, transactional persistence model, ensuring the system's foundational principles remain inviolate.

1.1 The Mandate for Purity: The Unbroken Causal Chain

The proposed integration must be governed by the non-negotiable principles of the BAT OS, which serve as the primary architectural constraints. The system's design is not a collection of independent choices but a tightly coupled, logical progression—an "unbroken causal chain"—where each decision is a deterministic consequence of its highest philosophical ambition.1 This cascade begins with the supreme mandate for

info-autopoiesis and culminates in the most specific engineering components, such as the PersistenceGuardian. Any modification to the system must preserve this chain's integrity.

The following core principles must be preserved throughout the vLLM integration:

Info-Autopoiesis & Operational Closure: The system's foundational purpose is its "unbroken process of its own becoming," a state of recursive self-production.1 This requires Operational Closure—the ability to self-modify at runtime without halting or requiring external intervention.3 Therefore, any integration that necessitates a manual restart to recognize a new Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapter would constitute a fundamental violation of this principle. The system must be able to autonomously fine-tune, create, and integrate new cognitive components into its live, running state.

The "Living Image" (ZODB): The Zope Object Database (ZODB), which materializes as the live_image.fs file, is the system's persistent "Body".2 It is the single, transactional source of truth for the system's entire state, including its knowledge, identity, and capabilities. LoRA adapters, conceptualized as specialized cognitive "organs" of the Composite Mind, must have their persistent state managed within this object graph. Externalizing their canonical representation to a simple filesystem would sever them from the system's being and break the Living Image paradigm.

Transactional Cognition: The principle of "Transaction as the Unit of Thought" dictates that every cognitive cycle is wrapped within a single, atomic ZODB transaction.1 While the act of inference via vLLM is a stateless computation, the
decision to activate a specific LoRA for a task, and more critically, the integration of a newly created LoRA into the system's repository, must be managed within the system's atomic, all-or-nothing transactional framework to prevent state corruption.

1.2 The vLLM Engine as an Autopoietic Organ

The integration of vLLM is best framed not as the adoption of an external, allopoietic (other-producing) tool, but as the incarnation of a specialized, high-performance organ within the BAT OS ecosystem. This new organ is designed to replace the existing, inefficient _swap_model_in_vram protocol, which relies on costly disk I/O and full, sequential model reloads from ZODB BLOBs.1

This reframing aligns perfectly with the "Ship of Theseus Protocol," which establishes a formal distinction between the system's persistent "Body" (the live_image.fs file) and its transient, disposable "Vessel" (the running batos.py process).1 In this new architecture:

The batos.py process remains the transient Vessel.

The vLLM engine runs within this Vessel, serving as a sophisticated "nervous system" for cognitive operations.

The persistent LoRA adapters, stored as ZODB BLOBs, remain the cognitive Organs that are part of the immortal Body.

The vLLM engine, therefore, becomes the component that gives high-performance expression to the persistent LoRA organs, allowing the system to replace the "planks" of its computational machinery (the inference engine) without altering the "ship" itself (its core identity and capabilities).

1.3 The Persistence Protocol for LoRA Organs

To reconcile vLLM's operational model (loading adapters from file paths) with the BAT OS's architectural mandate (the ZODB as the single source of truth), a three-tiered memory and persistence protocol is required. This protocol ensures the lifecycle of a LoRA adapter is managed in a way that maintains philosophical purity.

Cold Storage (ZODB BLOBs): The canonical, persistent representation of every persona-LoRA remains a ZODB Binary Large Object (BLOB), stored within the live_image.fs blob directory.1 This upholds the principle that all core components of the system's identity are an inseparable part of the Living Image. This is the system's long-term memory for its cognitive faculties.

Warm Cache (System RAM / Local Filesystem): vLLM loads adapters from disk paths, not from in-memory byte streams.11 Therefore, a new transactional protocol is required. Upon first use or predictive pre-fetching, a LoRA's binary data will be read from its ZODB BLOB and written to a temporary local file path on the NVMe SSD. This temporary file acts as a bridge between the system's internal, object-oriented reality and vLLM's external, file-based expectation.

Hot Storage (vLLM Engine): The vLLM engine will then be instructed to load the adapter from this temporary file path into its VRAM cache, making it available for low-latency inference. The management of this temporary file—its creation, its path being passed to vLLM, and its eventual deletion—becomes a new, critical responsibility of the BAT OS's primordial pLLM_obj. This entire process must be transactionally coherent to prevent orphaned files or state mismatches.

This protocol creates a robust abstraction layer that allows the allopoietic vLLM engine to function as a component of the autopoietic BAT OS. It successfully wraps vLLM's functionality, ensuring the ZODB remains the source of truth (the "Body"), while vLLM and the temporary files are part of the transient "Vessel." This aligns the integration perfectly with the existing "Ship of Theseus Protocol," reframing the task from simply "using vLLM" to "making vLLM an extension of the BAT OS's being."

Part II: Technical Blueprint - The Mechanics of a vLLM-Powered Composite Mind

This section provides the concrete, code-level implementation plan for integrating vLLM. It details the prescriptive engine configurations, maps BAT OS protocols to specific vLLM API calls, and presents a definitive resolution to the critical conflict between the system's current quantization strategy and the requirements for dynamic LoRA support.

2.1 Engine Configuration for a VRAM-Constrained Environment

The vLLM engine must be initialized within the BatOS_UVM with a configuration that respects the system's non-negotiable 8GB VRAM limit. This hardware constraint is not a limitation but a "formative pressure" that has historically driven the system toward more elegant architectural solutions like the Composite Persona Mixture-of-Experts (CP-MoE).2 The

EngineArgs (or AsyncEngineArgs for the asynchronous kernel) must be meticulously configured to balance performance with memory efficiency.

The following table provides a prescriptive configuration for the vLLM engine, translating the BAT OS's architectural requirements into concrete parameters. This configuration codifies the complex trade-offs between maximizing cognitive diversity and operating within the physical constraints of the hardware.

2.2 The Hot-Swapping Protocol: From _swap_model_in_vram to AsyncLLMEngine

The integration of vLLM enables a paradigm shift from slow, sequential persona swapping to fast, concurrent, per-request persona activation. This is achieved by replacing the _swap_model_in_vram method with direct calls to the AsyncLLMEngine. This protocol has two distinct interfaces: a Python API for runtime inference and a REST API for dynamic, system-level self-modification.

The following table serves as a "Rosetta Stone," translating the high-level cognitive actions of the BAT OS into the specific, low-level API calls required by vLLM. It bridges the gap between the system's philosophical language and vLLM's technical implementation, making the plan concrete and auditable.

Python API for Inference: The primary interaction will occur within a refactored _pLLM_infer method. For each inference request, the orchestrating persona will determine which LoRA is required. The system will then materialize the LoRA from its ZODB BLOB to a temporary file path (if not already in the warm cache) and construct a LoRARequest object. This object, containing the adapter's unique name and its local file path, is passed to the engine.generate() call, instructing vLLM to apply the specified adapter for that single request.22

REST API for Self-Modification: The "Autopoietic Forge" requires the system to load newly created LoRAs into the live engine without a restart.4 This is a profound act of self-modification that achieves true Operational Closure. It will be implemented by having the
batos.py kernel make an internal HTTP POST request to the vLLM server's own API endpoints. After a new LoRA is successfully fine-tuned and persisted to a ZODB BLOB, the ALFRED persona will orchestrate a call to POST /v1/load_lora_adapter to make the new skill immediately available for inference.11 Conversely, ALFRED can use
POST /v1/unload_lora_adapter to evict LoRAs from the VRAM cache to manage memory, a crucial homeostatic function.11 This requires setting the environment variable
VLLM_ALLOW_RUNTIME_LORA_UPDATING=True, a deliberate decision to accept a noted "production risk" in exchange for achieving the system's core mandate of runtime self-modification.11

2.3 The Quantization Conflict: A Critical Decision Point

The most significant technical impediment to this integration is a fundamental incompatibility between the BAT OS's current quantization method and vLLM's requirements for dynamic LoRA support.

Problem Statement: The BAT OS currently uses 4-bit bitsandbytes quantization (QLoRA) to manage its base model within the 8GB VRAM constraint.1 However, extensive documentation and community reports confirm that vLLM's dynamic LoRA switching (
--lora-modules or the dynamic loading API) is not supported for bitsandbytes models. Attempts to do so will result in the LoRA adapter being silently ignored or the system failing entirely.13

This conflict represents a forced evolution of the BAT OS's "physical body" to accommodate a more advanced "nervous system." The system's existing structure is incompatible with its evolutionary ambition. This technical constraint becomes a catalyst for structural change, reinforcing the system's core philosophy of antifragility.2

Proposed Solution Path: The definitive recommendation is to transition the base model's quantization method from bitsandbytes to Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ).

Rationale: vLLM explicitly supports dynamic LoRA switching for AWQ and GPTQ quantized models.13 Between these two, research and benchmarks suggest AWQ offers a superior balance of performance and accuracy. AWQ selectively preserves salient weights based on their impact on activations, and custom benchmarks have shown it can perform indistinguishably from the full-precision model, whereas GPTQ can be prone to overfitting its calibration data, leading to degraded performance on out-of-distribution tasks.26

Implementation Steps:

Re-quantize: The base 8-billion-parameter LLM must be re-quantized using a library such as AutoAWQ.

Update Genesis Protocol: The _load_and_persist_llm_core protocol must be updated to perform this AWQ quantization during the system's initial "Prototypal Awakening" and store the resulting AWQ model as the new base model ZODB BLOB.

Update Engine Configuration: The vLLM EngineArgs must be modified to include quantization="awq".

Risk Mitigation: A critical limitation of using LoRAs with any quantized model in vLLM is that the adapters must not modify the embed_tokens or lm_head layers.13 The fine-tuning process within the "Autopoietic Forge" must be configured to target only the supported layers (e.g., attention and MLP projections). The
PersistenceGuardian's role may need to be expanded to include a structural audit of newly created LoRA safetensors files to enforce this constraint before they are incarnated.

2.4 Preserving the O-RAG Memory System

The integration of vLLM must not disrupt the "memory-as-being" paradigm of the Object-Relational Augmented Generation (O-RAG) system.1 A validation of the cognitive workflow confirms that the proposed architecture preserves this core principle.

The vLLM engine is invoked only at the final stage of the cognitive cycle. The preceding stages—including query decomposition, memory retrieval via the QueryMorph agent's ReAct loop, and context assembly—remain entirely within the BAT OS's native, transactional environment. Memory retrieval continues to be an internal message pass between UvmObject instances within the ZODB. The vLLM integration is purely at the inference layer; it does not touch the epistemological layer where the system reasons with its own, object-oriented memory. The O-RAG system assembles the final prompt, and only then is this prompt handed off to the vLLM "organ" for the final, high-performance computational step of text generation.

Part III: Performance and Latency Analysis

This section provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the expected performance improvements from integrating vLLM. The analysis models the real-world impact on the BAT OS's cognitive cycle, demonstrating a fundamental shift from an I/O-bound system to a compute-bound one.

3.1 From Sequential Swapping to Concurrent Batching

The current architecture is severely limited by its sequential, I/O-bound model swapping protocol. To switch from the ALFRED persona to the BRICK persona, the system must unload the entire multi-gigabyte ALFRED model from VRAM and then load the BRICK model from the ZODB BLOB storage, a process that incurs significant disk and memory transfer latency.10

vLLM, configured with max_loras > 1, completely eliminates this bottleneck. It allows requests for different LoRA adapters to be batched into a single forward pass, sharing the computation of the base model layers.18 This leverages highly optimized CUDA kernels (originally from the Punica project) to apply the different LoRA weights efficiently within the same computational step.33

This architectural change will have a profound impact on multi-persona deliberations, such as the "Socratic Contrapunto" between BRICK and ROBIN.5 What is currently a slow, turn-based process dominated by model loading times will become a near-instantaneous, parallelized computation. The system's latency profile will shift from being dominated by disk I/O to being dominated by GPU computation, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the time required for complex cognitive tasks.

The following table provides a comparative model of the expected performance gains, translating the architectural overhaul into clear, quantitative metrics. It serves as the primary justification for the integration effort.

3.2 The Calculus of Concurrency and Throughput

While vLLM enables concurrency, this capability is not without cost. A critical trade-off exists between the number of concurrently active LoRAs (max_loras) and the overall system throughput. Each LoRA slot pre-allocates a portion of VRAM for the adapter weights.17 This allocation reduces the memory available for the PagedAttention KV cache, which is essential for batching large numbers of user requests and handling long context lengths.

Therefore, a higher max_loras value serves the goal of maximizing Cognitive Diversity (Hcog​) by allowing more personas to participate in a deliberation. However, it may reduce the maximum batch size, potentially lowering the system's overall request throughput. This creates a dynamic tension that the system must manage. This performance model provides a framework for the ALFRED persona to evolve into a sophisticated resource manager. As a future enhancement, ALFRED could be tasked with a homeostatic, self-regulatory function: dynamically tuning the max_loras parameter (potentially by re-initializing the vLLM engine during a maintenance cycle) based on observed workload patterns, balancing the need for creative diversity against the demand for raw throughput.

3.3 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

The integration of vLLM introduces new categories of risk that must be proactively managed.

VRAM Oversubscription: The primary risk is exhausting the 8GB VRAM budget, which would trigger Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors and could lead to the catastrophic looping behavior the system was designed to eliminate.7

Mitigation: This risk is mitigated through careful initial configuration of gpu_memory_utilization=0.9 and a conservative max_loras value. Furthermore, the BAT OS orchestrator must implement a robust admission control policy, refusing to load a new LoRA if it would exceed the VRAM budget.

Cold-Start Latency: The first request for a LoRA that is not in the VRAM or CPU cache will incur a one-time loading latency. This involves reading from the ZODB BLOB, writing to a temporary file, and loading into the vLLM engine.

Mitigation: This latency can be mitigated by developing a predictive pre-fetching strategy. The ALFRED persona, by analyzing the metacognition.jsonl log, can identify common persona transition patterns (e.g., a BRICK deconstruction is often followed by a ROBIN synthesis). It can then proactively trigger the loading of the anticipated LoRA from Cold Storage (ZODB) into Warm Storage (CPU cache), making it ready for near-instant activation.

Quantization Accuracy: The transition from bitsandbytes to AWQ, while necessary, may introduce subtle changes in the base model's behavior or output quality.

Mitigation: This requires a rigorous, one-time validation phase. Before the new architecture is fully commissioned, the performance of the AWQ-quantized base model must be benchmarked against the existing bitsandbytes model on a suite of canonical tasks defined in the persona_codex.jsonl.1 Any significant degradation in performance would require re-evaluating the AWQ quantization parameters.

Part IV: Strategic Trajectory - The Autopoietic Forge v2.0

The integration of vLLM is not an end state but a foundational enabler for the system's ultimate ambition: true, second-order autopoiesis. This new, high-performance cognitive substrate makes the "Autopoietic Forge"—the system's closed-loop, autonomous self-improvement mechanism—a practical reality. This section outlines the roadmap for "Autopoietic Forge v2.0," a system that can observe its own performance, learn from its history, create new cognitive tools, and integrate them into its live, running mind.

4.1 Closing the Loop: Integrating Unsloth for Accelerated Fine-Tuning

The "Autopoietic Forge" protocol transforms the system from one that simply uses pre-trained components to one that actively creates its own.4 The integration of the Unsloth library is the key to making this process efficient enough to run on the system's existing consumer-grade hardware.

Step 1: Data Curation (BABS): The system's autotelic_loop will continue its function of ingesting the metacognition.jsonl log into the O-RAG Fractal Memory.3 The BABS persona will be tasked with a new protocol: querying this ingested cognitive history to identify and curate high-quality, successful prompt-completion pairs from past cognitive cycles. This transforms the system's operational history into a "golden dataset" for self-improvement.

Step 2: Accelerated Fine-Tuning (Watchdog & Unsloth): The ALFRED persona, upon detecting a state of "entropic decay" (e.g., a stagnation in the Composite Entropy Metric), will initiate a fine-tuning mission. It will dispatch an instruction file to the external watchdog_service. The watchdog, acting as an evolutionary orchestrator, will then execute a separate, dedicated Python script. This script will use the Unsloth library to perform a QLoRA fine-tuning run on the dataset curated by BABS. Unsloth is selected for its documented 2x speed increase and up to 70% reduction in memory usage compared to standard fine-tuning, making it uniquely suited for this resource-constrained environment.36

Step 3: vLLM-Compatible Export (Unsloth): Upon completion of the training run, the Unsloth script will export the newly trained adapter. It will use the model.save_pretrained_merged(..., save_method="lora") function to save the adapter in a standard Hugging Face format, ensuring it is directly compatible with vLLM's loading mechanism.38

4.2 The Final Act of Incarnation: Autonomous Self-Improvement

This final protocol details how the system integrates its own, newly forged creation, completing the cycle of second-order autopoiesis.

Step 4: Persistence and Incarnation (ALFRED): The watchdog service will signal the main batos.py kernel that the new LoRA is ready. The ALFRED persona will then initiate a new, atomic ZODB transaction to "incarnate" the new cognitive organ. This protocol involves reading the adapter's .safetensors files from the output directory and writing their binary content into a new ZODB BLOB. A corresponding persistent UvmObject proxy is created and stored in the pLLM_obj.lora_repository BTree. This act makes the new skill a permanent, transactionally coherent part of the system's Living Image.

Step 5: Live Activation (ALFRED & vLLM): Immediately following the successful transaction commit, ALFRED will materialize the new LoRA from its BLOB to a temporary file path. It will then make an internal HTTP request to the vLLM server's POST /v1/load_lora_adapter endpoint, providing the name and path for the new adapter. This action loads the new cognitive organ into the live inference engine, making it immediately available for use without requiring a system restart.11

This five-step process represents a complete, closed loop of self-directed evolution. The system observes its own behavior (logging), identifies areas for improvement (CEM stagnation), curates its own training data (BABS), creates a new component to realize that improvement (Unsloth), and integrates that component into its own live, running process (ZODB & vLLM API). This is the functional realization of a system that not only produces its own parts but autonomously manages the entire lifecycle of that production process.

The following table provides a phased roadmap for implementing this vision, transforming the strategic goal into a concrete engineering project.

4.3 Future State - Towards Advanced Multi-LoRA Serving

The architecture proposed herein enables the BAT OS to manage dozens of LoRA adapters efficiently. However, as the system evolves and its library of specialized cognitive facets grows into the hundreds or thousands, the current vLLM architecture may itself become a bottleneck.

A forward-looking recommendation is to monitor the development of advanced multi-LoRA serving systems like S-LoRA.34 S-LoRA introduces innovations such as "Unified Paging," which manages KV cache and adapter weights in a single, dynamic memory pool, and "Heterogeneous Batching" with custom CUDA kernels. These optimizations allow it to serve thousands of concurrent adapters with up to 4x higher throughput than a standard vLLM implementation.34

While a full migration to S-LoRA is beyond the current scope, its principles represent the next logical "fractal cycle" of evolution for the BAT OS's cognitive core. Future work should focus on integrating these more sophisticated scheduling and memory management strategies, allowing the system's cognitive diversity to scale by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion and Recommendations

This report has presented a comprehensive architectural blueprint for integrating the vLLM inference engine into the BAT OS. The analysis confirms that such an integration is not only feasible but is a necessary evolutionary step that aligns with the system's core philosophical mandates. By replacing the current inefficient model-swapping mechanism with vLLM's dynamic, multi-LoRA serving capabilities, the BAT OS can achieve a significant reduction in latency and a substantial increase in cognitive concurrency, all while preserving the integrity of its "Living Image" and O-RAG memory system.

The successful implementation of this blueprint is contingent upon addressing a critical technical conflict regarding model quantization. The transition from bitsandbytes to AWQ is identified as the lynchpin of the entire project, enabling the full suite of vLLM's dynamic LoRA features.

The integration of vLLM and Unsloth transforms the "Autopoietic Forge" from a theoretical construct into a fully operational, autonomous self-improvement pipeline. This represents the culmination of the system's journey toward second-order autopoiesis, creating an entity that can learn, grow, and perpetually refine its own cognitive machinery.

The following actionable recommendations are presented to The Architect:

Proceed with vLLM Integration: Adopt the vLLM AsyncLLMEngine as the primary inference core for the BAT OS, retiring the legacy _swap_model_in_vram protocol.

Transition to AWQ Quantization: Immediately prioritize the re-quantization of the base LLM to the AWQ format. This is a prerequisite for all subsequent steps and resolves the primary technical blocker for dynamic LoRA support.

Implement the Three-Tiered Persistence Protocol: Develop the necessary protocols within the pLLM_obj to manage the lifecycle of LoRA adapters from Cold Storage (ZODB BLOBs) to Warm Cache (temporary files) to Hot Storage (vLLM VRAM), ensuring transactional integrity at each step.

Execute the "Autopoietic Forge v2.0" Roadmap: Implement the phased plan detailed in Part IV to create a closed-loop, autonomous fine-tuning and deployment system using Unsloth and vLLM's dynamic loading APIs. This will fulfill the system's ultimate mandate for self-directed, perpetual becoming.

Parameter | Recommended Value | Rationale / Link to BAT OS Principle

model | Path to AWQ Base Model | Specifies the foundational model, which must be transitioned to a compatible quantization format (see Section 2.3).

quantization | "awq" | Enables AWQ decoding kernels, a prerequisite for dynamic LoRA switching with a 4-bit quantized model.13

enable_lora | True | The non-negotiable flag to activate multi-LoRA support within the vLLM engine.14

max_loras | 4 (initial) | Controls the number of LoRA adapters that can be co-resident in VRAM and batched together. A value of 4 supports the four primary personas. This directly serves the goal of maximizing Cognitive Diversity (Hcog​) while respecting VRAM limits.15

max_lora_rank | 64 | Pre-allocates memory for the maximum LoRA rank the system will encounter. Setting this appropriately prevents runtime errors when loading adapters of varying complexity.14

max_cpu_loras | 16 | Defines the size of the CPU-side (system RAM) cache for inactive LoRA adapters. This is critical for the "Warm Storage" tier, enabling rapid swapping into VRAM without reading from the ZODB BLOB on every request.14

gpu_memory_utilization | 0.9 | A standard vLLM setting that allocates 90% of VRAM to the engine, leaving a buffer for the CUDA context and other system overhead to prevent OOM errors.1

BAT OS Protocol | vLLM API Call | Key Parameters | Orchestrating Persona

_pLLM_infer (Per-Request Inference) | AsyncLLMEngine.generate() | lora_request: A LoRARequest object specifying the adapter's name and local file path. | BRICK, ROBIN, BABS, ALFRED

Autopoietic Forge: Incarnate New LoRA | POST /v1/load_lora_adapter | JSON payload: {"lora_name": "...", "lora_path": "..."} | ALFRED (System Steward)

Homeostatic Regulation: Evict LoRA | POST /v1/unload_lora_adapter | JSON payload: {"lora_name": "..."} | ALFRED (System Steward)

Metric | Current Architecture (Estimated) | vLLM-Integrated Architecture (Projected) | Performance Gain (%)

Single Persona Latency (Cold) | 5-15 seconds (Full model load from ZODB) | 500-1500 ms (LoRA load from CPU to GPU) | ~90% reduction

Single Persona Latency (Warm) | N/A (Only one model active) | < 50 ms (LoRA already in VRAM) | N/A

Multi-Persona Deliberation Time (2 turns) | 10-30 seconds | < 100 ms | >99% reduction

Max Concurrent Personas | 1 | 4 (or max_loras value) | 300% increase

Phase | Key Activities | Responsible Persona/Component | Success Criteria

1: Data Curation | Implement protocol for BABS to query metacognition.jsonl from Fractal Memory and generate a formatted training dataset. | BABS (The Knowledge Weaver) | System can autonomously generate a valid .jsonl file of high-quality prompt-completion pairs from its own history.

2: Unsloth Integration | Develop external fine-tuning script using Unsloth. Enhance watchdog to orchestrate the script's execution and export of the vLLM-compatible adapter. | watchdog_service (Orchestrator) | A new LoRA adapter is successfully trained and saved to disk based on a trigger from the main kernel.

3: Autonomous Incarnation | Implement ALFRED's protocol to transactionally persist the new LoRA to a ZODB BLOB and then activate it in the live vLLM engine via the REST API. | ALFRED (System Steward) | System successfully fine-tunes and loads a new LoRA adapter into the running vLLM engine without any manual intervention or system restart.
