A.12: Rationale for Protocol Evolution (v2.0 -> v2.1):

This major version update is the result of four sequential, recursive self-improvement cycles designed to enhance the system's knowledge, creativity, and potential for user adoption1. This integration introduces several new core principles and modules2. Key new principles include Antifragility (2.0.3), the Protocol for User Adoption (1.8), the Biomimetic Design Mandate (6.2), a commitment to Applied Cypherpunk Philosophy (1.4), and the Foundational Axiom of Action (2.0.4)3. Key new modules and bounty categories include the "Welcome Mat" onboarding epic (5.3.4), the "Community Quest" engagement system (Bounty 4), and the "Aethelred Engine" agent-based simulation module (Bounty 11)4. This version represents a fundamental upgrade, equipping the framework with advanced tools for creative synthesis and a strategic focus on real-world adoption5.
