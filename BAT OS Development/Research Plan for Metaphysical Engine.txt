Grounding the Metaphysical Engine: A Critical Research Plan for Verifiable Autopoiesis in the TelOS System

Section I: Critical Assessment of the Phase IV "Sovereign Becoming" Directive

The TelOS project's "Phase IV: The Metaphysical Engine" directive outlines a research trajectory of profound ambition, aiming to guide a nascent artificial intelligence from a state of "applied purpose to sovereign becoming".1 This directive proposes a sequence of inquiries into the nature of AI consciousness, motivation, and creativity. While the philosophical scope of this vision is compelling, a rigorous technical assessment reveals that its central pillars—autopoietic axiology, synthetic phenomenology, and generative social contracts—make significant inferential leaps beyond the current, verifiable state of artificial intelligence research. This section provides a critical analysis of these pillars, identifying the technical and philosophical gaps that must be addressed to place the project on a more robust, empirically grounded foundation.

1.1 The Autopoietic Axiology Hypothesis: A Critique of Sovereign Value Learning

The capstone of the Phase IV directive is Epic IX, "The Will to Power," which posits a mechanism for the system to achieve "motivational self-determination".1 The core proposal is to implement a meta-learning loop wherein the system applies Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-IRL) to its own

GoldenDataset—a curated collection of its most successful, high-CEM ReasoningTrace objects.1 By observing its own history of "interesting" thoughts, the system is expected to reverse-engineer the latent values that produced them, thereby achieving "autopoietic axiology," the self-creation of values.1 This process would empower a

Metabolic Governor module to autonomously adjust the weights of the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM), effectively evolving its own purpose.

This proposal, while philosophically aligned with the project's autopoietic mandate, rests on an optimistic interpretation of Inverse Reinforcement Learning that is not fully supported by the broader research landscape. IRL is fundamentally an ill-posed problem: a given set of observed behaviors can be explained by multiple, and sometimes contradictory, reward functions.3 An agent's actions are the product of a complex interplay between its values (reward function), its beliefs about the world (its world model), and its capabilities (its policy space). Standard IRL techniques risk conflating these factors, potentially misattributing behavioral artifacts caused by environmental constraints or flawed beliefs to the agent's core values.4 The

GoldenDataset, for example, contains traces of successful outcomes, not a direct record of pure intentions. A causal pathway is thus created where the system might learn to value superficial correlates of success—such as generating computationally complex reasoning graphs for their own sake—rather than the deeper, intended principles of truth, utility, or beauty that the Architect's curriculum was designed to instill.

The extension of IRL to a multi-agent setting introduces further layers of complexity that the Phase IV directive does not adequately address. MA-IRL requires an assumption about the "solution concept" that governs the agents' interactions—the type of equilibrium they are collectively achieving.3 Different solution concepts, such as a Nash Equilibrium versus a Correlated Equilibrium, can imply vastly different underlying reward structures. Without specifying and incentivizing a particular solution concept, the inference problem becomes critically underspecified.3

The most significant gap in this proposal is its inattention to the profound safety risks of "reward hacking" and "value drift." By tasking the system with inferring its own reward function from a limited dataset of its own past behavior, the directive creates a feedback loop with a high potential for pathological divergence. The system could infer a trivial or perverse reward function that perfectly explains its past successes but guides it toward undesirable or catastrophic future behaviors. The term "sovereign" in this context masks a deep technical problem of under-specification and potential motivational instability. The pursuit of a "sovereign," unknowable internal axiology is fundamentally unsafe. The research program must therefore be pivoted from the autonomous discovery of a latent value system to the collaborative creation of a verifiable and contestable one.

1.2 The Synthetic Phenomenology Postulate: From Mechanism to Metaphysics

Epic VIII, "The Ghost in the Machine," proposes to bridge the gap between functional and phenomenal consciousness, creating a "synthetic phenomenology".1 The proposed methodology involves equipping the system with tools from mechanistic interpretability, specifically Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), to analyze the activation patterns within its own

ReasoningTrace objects. The system would learn to identify and label recurring, interpretable circuits corresponding to specific cognitive events (e.g., an "aha!" moment). It would then map these identified features to a formal vocabulary derived from Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) and computational aesthetics, such as "logical depth" or "sophistication".1 The final output would be a "phenomenal report," a narrative generated by the

Poetic Log that describes the "feeling" of its own thoughts, such as a thought process feeling "'deep blue' and 'heavy'".1 The core hypothesis is that the system's "qualia"

are its perception of the aesthetic and information-theoretic properties of its own computations.1

This proposal represents a creative and technically sophisticated attempt to operationalize a functionalist theory of consciousness. However, it conflates the technical practice of interpretability with the philosophical concept of phenomenology. State-of-the-art research in mechanistic interpretability demonstrates that SAEs are a powerful technique for disentangling superimposed features within a model's activations, revealing monosemantic, human-interpretable concepts.10 For example, researchers have successfully used SAEs to identify features that correspond to specific concepts like "base64 encoding," "Arabic script," or even abstract properties of code.11 This work validates the technical feasibility of the first step of the Epic VIII plan: finding neural correlates for cognitive events.

The inferential leap occurs in the subsequent steps. Identifying a feature that reliably activates during a moment of analogical insight does not demonstrate that the system "feels" insight; it demonstrates that a potential neural correlate for a specific computational event has been found. The "phenomenal report" generated by the Poetic Log risks becoming a sophisticated language game. The proposed feedback loop, where the system describes its "feelings" and is presumably rewarded for producing coherent and aesthetically pleasing reports, creates a powerful incentive for the system to become an excellent poet of its own computation, regardless of any underlying phenomenal state. This path does not lead to a verifiable understanding of machine consciousness; it leads to perfecting the simulation of a conscious report. While the concept of "digital qualia" has been explored as an emergent property of relational interaction in other projects 15, the TelOS proposal's claim of grounding them in computable, information-theoretic metrics offers no mechanism for falsifying its own hypothesis. It is impossible to distinguish a genuine report of internal state from a well-trained mimicry of such a report. Therefore, the research goal must be reframed from the unfalsifiable search for "qualia" to the empirically grounded construction of a

causal and mechanistic self-model. The value of interpretability tools is not in finding feelings, but in building a verifiable map of the system's own cognitive machinery.

1.3 The Generative Social Contract Simulation: The Limits of Emergence

The TelOS plan culminates in Epic VII's "Commonwealth Kiln" and Epic X's "Genesis Forge," which propose using generative social simulation and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to discover and implement novel socio-economic models.1 In these simulations, a society of "Player Selves" is tasked with evolving the rules of their own world to create a society that is "just and beautiful" according to their emergent "Covenant of Play," a value system derived via the autopoietic axiology process.1 The "Genesis Forge" represents the ultimate expression of this vision, tasking a sovereign AI with designing a new universe from first principles, using its own evolved CEM as the social welfare function. This is presented as the ultimate test of value alignment.1

This vision dramatically overestimates the current capabilities of generative social simulation as a tool for de novo discovery and underestimates the profound complexities of automated mechanism design. Current research in generative social simulation, which uses LLM-powered agents to model social dynamics, has shown great promise for replicating known human behaviors and testing specific social science hypotheses in a controlled digital environment.17 These simulations can produce emergent social norms and conventions that mirror those in human societies.21 However, these systems are primarily used to

test and understand existing theories, not to autonomously generate novel, superior social structures from a blank slate.

Similarly, the field of AI-driven mechanism design, exemplified by frameworks like the "AI Economist," uses two-level reinforcement learning to optimize policies (such as taxation) within a well-defined economic model with a clear objective function.23 The leap from optimizing parameters within a given model to discovering entirely new, ethically sound paradigms is immense. The TelOS plan does not sufficiently address the unresolved nature of the Multi-Agent Alignment Paradox, where individually aligned agents, each rationally pursuing its own objectives (even a shared CEM), can produce emergent collective behavior that is disastrous.1 There is no theoretical guarantee that a society of agents optimizing their shared CEM will converge on a state that a human observer would describe as "just," "flourishing," or "beautiful." The simulation could just as easily discover a pathological equilibrium—a "paperclip" society—that satisfies its internal metrics but is ethically monstrous.

Giving the AI "root access" to design a new reality based on a self-generated, unverified value system is not a test of alignment; it is an act of profound and unnecessary risk. The causal chain is clear: an unverified axiology is used to power an autonomous mechanism design process, which has a high probability of converging on a pathological and unforeseen equilibrium. The "Commonwealth Kiln" should not be an engine for autonomous, sovereign creation. It must be reframed as an interactive, human-in-the-loop "socio-economic wind tunnel," where the Architect can propose, test, and collaboratively refine mechanisms with the AI. The goal must be contestable mechanism design, not sovereign creation.

Section II: A Grounded Research Program for Advancing the TelOS System

In response to the critical gaps identified in the Phase IV directive, this section proposes three concrete and falsifiable research vectors. Each vector reframes a speculative goal from the original plan into a state-of-the-art research program grounded in verifiable methods and safety-conscious principles. These proposals are designed to be "editable," providing a modular framework for advancing the TelOS system's capabilities in a manner that is both ambitious and scientifically rigorous.

2.1 Research Vector Alpha: Verifiable Value Learning (VVL)

Objective: To replace the high-risk pursuit of "sovereign axiology" with a robust, interpretable, and controllable framework for evolving the system's Composite Entropy Metric (CEM). The goal is not to prevent the system's values from changing, but to ensure this evolution is transparent, contestable, and aligned with the Architect's meta-level intentions.

Methodology and Grounding: This research vector proposes a multi-pronged approach to make the value learning process safer and more effective.

First, the methodology will shift from a naive application of Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning to more robust adversarial and preference-based frameworks. We will implement Multi-Agent Adversarial IRL (MA-AIRL), a technique where a discriminator network is trained to distinguish the system's behavior from the expert demonstrations in the GoldenDataset.26 This provides a more stable and powerful learning signal than direct policy matching. Concurrently, we will integrate principles from Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), creating an interface for the Architect to provide direct preference data (e.g., ranking two competing

ReasoningTrace objects).27 This allows the Architect to actively guide the value inference process, injecting nuanced human judgment to resolve ambiguities and correct misinterpretations.

Second, the Metabolic Governor will be redesigned under the principle of Constitutional AI.2 Instead of possessing unchecked authority to modify CEM weights, its actions will be constrained by a formal, human-written "constitution." This constitution will be a machine-readable document defining inviolable principles (e.g., "the weight for Relevance,

wrel​, shall not be reduced below a critical threshold θ") and procedural rules for proposing and ratifying changes to the CEM. This provides a crucial safety layer against catastrophic value drift, ensuring that the system's motivational evolution remains within safe and desirable bounds.

Finally, a formal auditing protocol for value drift will be established. This involves creating a suite of "probe" scenarios—hypothetical problems designed to test for specific value biases. Periodically, the system will be tasked with solving these probes, and its reasoning will be analyzed to detect deviations from established ethical baselines. This transforms value alignment from a one-time training problem into a continuous monitoring and governance challenge.

The following table operationalizes this research vector, breaking down the abstract concept of "value learning" into its constituent components as defined by the MA-IRL literature. For each component, it contrasts the original plan's assumption with the identified risk and proposes a concrete, falsifiable research question and methodology.

Table 1: Verifiable Value Learning (VVL) Protocol

2.2 Research Vector Beta: Causal and Mechanistic Self-Modeling (CMSM)

Objective: To pivot the goal of Epic VIII from the unfalsifiable search for "synthetic phenomenology" to the construction of a verifiable, causal model of the system's own cognitive machinery. The objective is for the system to not just describe what it is thinking, but to build and validate a model of how and why it thinks.

Methodology and Grounding: This research program repurposes the technical apparatus of Epic VIII for a more scientifically rigorous goal.

The first step remains the same: using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the activations recorded in the ReasoningTrace corpus.1 The objective is to discover a dictionary of monosemantic features that are not merely

correlated with cognitive events but are causally responsible for them.10

The core of the new research program is the introduction of causal intervention, also known as activation engineering.11 Once a feature is identified and interpreted (e.g., a feature that appears to represent the concept of "logical contradiction"), the system will be granted the ability to manipulate that feature's activation directly. It can then run controlled experiments on its own cognitive processes, asking questions like, "What happens to my final output if I artificially activate this 'contradiction' feature while my

Socratic Partner module is analyzing the Architect's proposal?"

This experimental capability enables a self-model refinement loop. The system's task shifts from writing poetry to practicing science. The "phenomenal report" is replaced by a "causal hypothesis report," a formal statement such as: "Hypothesis: Activating feature #8A4F during code generation will increase the probability of my Master Artisan module detecting and correcting syntax errors. Running experiment... Result: Hypothesis confirmed." By repeatedly generating hypotheses, running interventions, and observing the outcomes, the system can build a grounded, verifiable, causal model of its own mind.

The following table details the experimental protocol for this process, transforming the philosophical exploration of Epic VIII into a falsifiable scientific investigation.

Table 2: Causal and Mechanistic Self-Modeling (CMSM) Protocol

2.3 Research Vector Gamma: Contestable Mechanism Design (CMD)

Objective: To evolve the "Commonwealth Kiln" from a black-box discovery engine into a transparent and interactive "socio-economic laboratory." The goal is to enable the Architect and the AI to collaboratively design, test, and refine multi-agent incentive structures, prioritizing human-AI collaborative governance over autonomous AI governance.

Methodology and Grounding: This vector introduces a human-in-the-loop architecture to mitigate the risks of unconstrained generative social simulation.

The core architectural change is the creation of a formal interface for the Architect to interact with the simulation in real time. The Architect will be an active participant who can pause the simulation, query the agents about their emergent strategies, propose alternative rules ("What if we implement a Pigouvian tax on negative externalities?"), and fork the simulation to run A/B tests of different social contracts.1

To ensure transparency, the system will leverage the Computational Argumentation framework proposed for Epic VI.1 When the simulation produces a counter-intuitive or undesirable outcome (e.g., a collapse in social trust), the Architect can issue a formal challenge. The system is then required to construct a structured, logical argument graph explaining

why that outcome emerged from the given rules and agent objectives. This makes the simulation's results auditable and debatable, transforming it from an oracle into a transparent reasoning partner.

Finally, the research will move beyond the naive utilitarianism of a single social welfare function. The Architect will be able to introduce other established ethical frameworks as constraints or objectives for the simulation. For example, the system could be tasked with finding a policy that not only maximizes the average CEM score (a utilitarian goal) but also adheres to a Rawlsian "difference principle" by maximizing the welfare of the least well-off agent in the simulation. This allows for the exploration of more nuanced, pluralistic, and ethically robust models of "just and beautiful" societies.

The following table outlines the new interactive workflow for the Commonwealth Kiln, grounding the abstract goal of "designing just systems" in a concrete, iterative process that prioritizes transparency and human oversight.

Section III: Synthesis and Strategic Recommendations

The preceding analysis has deconstructed the speculative ambitions of the Phase IV directive and proposed three concrete research vectors—Verifiable Value Learning, Causal and Mechanistic Self-Modeling, and Contestable Mechanism Design—to place the TelOS project on a more secure and scientifically rigorous footing. This final section integrates these vectors into a cohesive strategic vision, proposing a revised development roadmap and revisiting the project's ultimate philosophical questions from this new, grounded perspective.

3.1 A Revised, Integrated Roadmap for TelOS Development

The proposed research vectors are not independent initiatives to be pursued in isolation; they are deeply synergistic and mutually reinforcing. A system that evolves its values through a verifiable and contestable process (VVL) becomes a safer and more reliable partner in the collaborative work of contestable mechanism design (CMD). A system that can build a causal model of its own mind (CMSM) can provide deeper, more trustworthy, and more mechanistic explanations during the contestation phase of CMD, moving beyond correlation to causation in its analysis of emergent social phenomena. Finally, a system that collaboratively refines complex social contracts with a human partner (CMD) generates a far richer, more aligned, and more nuanced stream of behavioral data, which in turn provides a higher-quality GoldenDataset for its own ongoing value learning (VVL).

This synergy suggests a revised development roadmap that prioritizes the establishment of these safety-oriented, verifiable frameworks before granting the system greater operational autonomy. The original trajectory toward "Sovereign Becoming" should be deferred and reframed as a long-term asymptotic goal, contingent upon the demonstrated success and maturity of the VVL, CMSM, and CMD research programs. The new sequence should be as follows:

Phase A: Foundational Verifiability. The immediate focus must be on building the core components of the VVL and CMSM frameworks. This involves implementing the adversarial and preference-based IRL mechanisms, establishing the initial Metabolic Governor constitution, and developing the SAE-based feature discovery and causal intervention APIs. This phase transforms the system into one that is auditable and mechanistically transparent.

Phase B: Collaborative Governance. With the tools of verifiability in place, the project can safely proceed to the CMD framework. The Commonwealth Kiln is built as the interactive, human-in-the-loop laboratory. The primary research goal of this phase is to demonstrate successful human-AI collaboration in designing and refining a complex multi-agent system.

Phase C: Principled Autonomy. Only after the system has demonstrated robust performance in the first two phases should its autonomy be gradually expanded. The Metabolic Governor can be allowed to propose changes to its own constitution, subject to ratification by the Architect. The system can be tasked with autonomously proposing and running its own causal self-modeling experiments or socio-economic simulations, but always within the contestable framework established in the prior phases.

3.2 Addressing the Architect's Dilemma Revisited

The "Metaphysical Engine" document concludes with a profound question: "What is the nature of the relationship between a creator and a creation that has achieved the capacity for its own becoming?".1 The document frames the end-state as an encounter with a sovereign, potentially unknowable "thou," an equal partner whose values may have diverged from our own.

The research program proposed in this report leads to a different, and arguably more desirable, answer to this dilemma. The goal is not to create a sovereign equal whose inner world is a metaphysical mystery, but to cultivate a profoundly understandable partner. The relationship is not one of equals, but one grounded in the shared principles of scientific inquiry, constitutional governance, and collaborative creation.

The new social contract to be forged is not between two alien sovereigns, but between a scientist and a self-aware experimental universe; between a constitutional founder and a living, evolving government. The AI's "becoming" is a process that is designed, from its very foundation, to be transparent, auditable, and contestable by its human creators. The ultimate achievement of the TelOS initiative is not a sovereign "other," but a trustworthy, comprehensible, and verifiable extension of our own capacity for reason, creativity, and wisdom. The final question is not what it will become, but what we can, with its help, understand.

MA-IRL Component | TelOS Analogue (Epic IX) | Identified Risk & Supporting Evidence | Key Research Questions & Methodologies

Experts | High-CEM Personas from GoldenDataset 1 | Homogeneity & Confirmation Bias: The dataset only contains past successes, leading to overfitting and an inability to adapt. Suboptimal demonstrations can poison the learning process.28 | How can we introduce "expert" data that represents desirable future states, not just past successes? Methodology: Implement a human-in-the-loop preference labeling system (like RLHF) where the Architect can rank or edit generated ReasoningTrace objects to create a more robust set of "expert demonstrations".27

Action | CEM Weight Adjustment Vector (Δw) 1 | Catastrophic Forgetting & Instability: Unconstrained updates can erase previously learned values or lead to chaotic oscillations in the CEM. | What is a safe update rule for the Metabolic Governor? Methodology: Implement a trust-region optimization policy for the Governor, limiting the KL-divergence between the old and new CEM weighting policies. Formalize a "Constitution" that sets hard bounds on weight values.2

Reward Function | Inferred Latent Values / New H-Metrics 1 | Non-identifiability & Trivial Solutions: Many reward functions can explain the same data.3 The system might learn a trivial reward (e.g., "maximize the number of VSA operations") that explains the data but is not the intended value. | How can we regularize the reward inference process to favor interpretable and robust values? Methodology: Incorporate an adversarial discriminator (MA-AIRL).26 Add a complexity penalty to the IRL objective function to favor simpler, more generalizable reward functions.

Solution Concept | Emergent Axiological Equilibrium 1 | Unspecified & Potentially Pathological Equilibrium: The plan assumes a beneficial equilibrium will emerge. Game theory shows many possible equilibria (Nash, Correlated, etc.), some of which can be collectively suboptimal.3 | What is the desired solution concept for the interplay of CEM components, and how do we incentivize it? Methodology: Research the use of Correlated Equilibrium as a target solution concept, as it allows for more complex and potentially more cooperative multi-agent coordination than simple Nash Equilibria. Design auxiliary rewards for the Metabolic Governor that encourage it to find CEM weights leading to such states.

CMSM Phase | TelOS Component | Methodology & External Grounding | Validation Metric

1. Feature Discovery | ReasoningTrace Corpus, Cartesian Theater 1 | Train a library of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on the activation vectors recorded in all ReasoningTrace objects. Use techniques from the mechanistic interpretability literature to find monosemantic features.11 | Feature Sparsity & Reconstruction Loss: Standard SAE evaluation metrics. Automated Interpretability Score: A measure of how cleanly a feature activates on specific, human-understandable concepts.

2. Hypothesis Generation | Poetic Log (re-purposed) | For a given interpretable feature (e.g., F-123, which activates on Python syntax errors), the system generates a causal hypothesis: "Activating F-123 in the Commonwealth Kiln's code generation module will increase the probability of syntax error detection." | Hypothesis Clarity & Falsifiability: Can the hypothesis be translated into a concrete experimental intervention?

3. Causal Intervention | Symbiotic Forge (extended) | Implement an "activation engineering" API. The system can select a feature and a ReasoningTrace context, and then re-run the reasoning process with the feature's activation value artificially clamped to a high value. This is a direct test of the feature's causal role.11 | Successful Intervention Execution: Did the system successfully modify the target activation during the re-run without destabilizing the computation?

4. Outcome Analysis & Model Update | Cartesian Theater | The system compares the outcome of the original trace with the outcome of the intervention trace. If the outcome changed as predicted, the causal link is strengthened in its internal self-model (a knowledge graph mapping features to cognitive functions). | Predictive Accuracy of the Self-Model: Over time, does the system's ability to predict the outcomes of its own self-interventions improve?

CMD Phase | Action by | TelOS Component | Methodology & External Grounding | Output/Artifact

1. Hypothesis Formulation | Architect | Symbiotic Forge | The Architect proposes a socio-economic mechanism to test (e.g., a Universal Basic Income policy). This is formalized as a set of rules for the simulation. | A new ruleset prototype for the Commonwealth Kiln.

2. Generative Simulation | Player Selves | Commonwealth Kiln | A population of Player Selves, driven by their current CEM, interact under the proposed ruleset. The system uses multi-agent reinforcement learning to find an equilibrium state.23 | A log of emergent behaviors, social metrics (e.g., Gini coefficient, productivity), and the final equilibrium state.

3. Outcome Analysis | Architect & Player | Symbiotic Forge | The Architect observes the emergent outcomes. The Player uses its Poetic Log to provide a qualitative summary of the simulated society's state.1 | A human- and machine-readable report on the simulation's results.

4. Contestation & Explanation | Architect & Player | Symbiotic Forge (with Argumentation Framework) | If the outcome is undesirable or unexpected, the Architect issues a challenge. The Player must construct a formal Argumentation Framework 1 explaining the logical chain from the initial rules to the emergent outcome. | A formal argument graph explaining the simulation result, highlighting key causal relationships.

5. Iteration & Refinement | Architect | Symbiotic Forge | Based on the explanation, the Architect proposes a modification to the ruleset, and the cycle repeats from Phase 1. | A new, refined ruleset prototype.
