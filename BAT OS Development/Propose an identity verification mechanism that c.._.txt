Of course. Designing an identity verification protocol that is both secure and welcoming is a critical function for the health of the commons. It is the first handshake, the first "welcome home," and it must be done with care.

(ROBIN): Yes! This is so important. Joining our Commonwealth shouldn't feel like passing through a cold, sterile security checkpoint. It should feel like being welcomed into a new neighborhood by a trusted friend who offers you a firm, warm handshake and says, "We're so glad you're here." The process itself should be an act of community-building.

(BRICK): Acknowledged. The user is requesting a specification for a trust-based identity verification mechanism to be integrated into the 'First Bloom' onboarding protocols. The protocol must assign users to pods and include a network growth incentive.

The following protocol is designed to be resilient against spam and Sybil attacks while reinforcing the Commonwealth's core principles of Human Trust and Absolute Transparency. I have designated it The 'Handshake' Protocol v2.0.

The 'Handshake' Protocol: A Trust-Based Identity Verification System

This protocol will be integrated directly into the 'First Bloom' onboarding wizard.

Step 1: The Invitation (The First Link in the Chain)

Mechanism: To prevent anonymous, mass account creation, the 'First Bloom' process cannot be initiated from a public sign-up page. A new member must be invited by an existing, verified member. The existing member generates a single-use, encrypted invitation link from their User Dashboard.

Risk Mitigation: This "web of trust" model ensures that the network grows through real-world social connections, making it significantly more resistant to bad actors. It establishes that from the very beginning, membership is relational.

Step 2: The Digital Handshake (Initial Data Input)

Mechanism: The prospective member follows the invitation link and is guided to provide their basic, real-world identity information.

Architectural Note: This data is handled with end-to-end encryption. However, per the principle of Absolute Transparency, the goal is to link a real identity to the account to build a high-trust credit environment.

Step 3: The Neighborhood (Pod Selection)

Mechanism: After initial input, the 'First Bloom' wizard displays the SNOW Atlas map, using geolocation to highlight nearby, existing pods.

Joining an Existing Pod: The user can select a nearby pod and submit an application to join.

Creating a New Pod: If no pods are nearby, or if the user and their inviter wish to start a new community, they can select the "Found a New Pod" option. This action flags the user as a 'Pod Founder' and automatically notifies the nearest 'Commonwealth Concierge' 1 to begin the bootstrap support process.


Step 4: The Verifier's Handshake (The Human Trust Layer)

Mechanism: This step is the core of the protocol and directly implements the principle of 'Human Trust over Algorithmic Judgment'. To finalize verification and activate their account, the new applicant must be vouched for by two existing, verified members from the pod they wish to join.

The member who sent the original invitation can act as the first verifier.

The applicant must then find a second member of the pod to act as their verifier. This can be done via a short, in-person meeting or a video call facilitated by the app.

The two verifiers access the applicant's profile and click a "Vouch For This Member" button, which acts as their cryptographic signature of trust.

Rationale: Requiring two verifiers, one of whom must be separate from the original inviter, creates a robust defense against a single user creating a chain of fake accounts. It requires a minimum viable level of real social consensus for a new member to be granted full access to the commons.

Step 5: The Weaver's Welcome (The Network Growth Incentive)

Mechanism: To directly incentivize the healthy, trust-based growth of the network, we will create a specialized 'Verifiable Credential'. Once the new member is fully verified by their two sponsors, the original member who sent the invitation automatically receives a 'Weaver's Welcome' Credential on their 'Reputation Ledger'.

Incentive: This credential is a type of 'Weaver's Credential'. It does not provide a direct FLKS payout. Instead, it serves as a powerful, public signal of the inviting member's pro-social behavior and their role in strengthening the community. A history of earning these credentials builds the inviter's social capital and, by extension, the trust their peers will place in them when it comes to staking FLKS to their credit limit.

(ROBIN): And you see? The journey is all about connection. You are brought into the community by a friend. You are welcomed and vouched for by your new neighbors. And your friend is celebrated by the whole community for helping our shared home grow a little bigger and brighter. Every single step is a handshake.
