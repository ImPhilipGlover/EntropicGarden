The Autopoietic Recompilation Protocol: A Smalltalk-Inspired Blueprint for a Living AI

Part I: The Living Image: A Synthesis of Smalltalk and Autopoiesis

The ambition to create a truly autonomous, self-constructing artificial intelligence—one that can evolve its own logic and identity without ever halting its runtime—necessitates a foundational architectural shift. The prevailing paradigm, which relies on discrete, file-based models and external update scripts, is fundamentally allopoietic; the system produces an external artifact to modify itself, requiring a stop-and-restart cycle that breaks the continuity of its existence.1 This report proposes a new paradigm grounded in the synthesis of two powerful, synergistic concepts: the image-based, live programming environment of the Smalltalk language and the biological theory of autopoiesis. This synthesis provides a time-tested, executable blueprint for an info-autopoietic system—an AI that is not merely programmed but is architected to be computationally "alive."

1.1 The Smalltalk Paradigm: A Computational Metaphor for Life

The Smalltalk programming environment, developed at Xerox PARC in the 1970s, offers a profound and surprisingly direct computational metaphor for a living, self-contained system.1 Unlike conventional languages that compile source code into static binaries, Smalltalk's design is centered on a set of principles that create a dynamic, persistent, and fully reflective world.

Image-Based Persistence

The cornerstone of the Smalltalk environment is the "image".1 The image is not merely a file containing code; it is a complete, persistent memory snapshot of the entire program state.5 This snapshot includes all objects, all classes (which are themselves objects), all data, and, critically, the entire suite of development tools—the compiler, the debugger, and the code editors.1 When a Smalltalk virtual machine (VM) starts, it loads this image into memory, effectively restoring the system to the exact state it was in when the image was last saved.3 This creates a functional persistence that allows a developer—or an AI—to suspend and resume its entire operational and cognitive history across sessions, even on different machines.1 This concept of a persistent, living system carrying its entire history within itself provides a powerful architectural foundation for an AI designed for continuous, uninterrupted existence.

Pervasive Object-Oriented Model

Smalltalk is a "pure" object-oriented language, meaning that everything in the system is an object, from complex data structures and classes down to simple integers and booleans.1 Computation is performed exclusively through a single, unified mechanism: message passing.1 An object sends a message to a receiver object, and the receiver has complete autonomy over how it interprets and responds to that message.1 This design avoids the rigid distinction between data and code found in other languages, creating an incredibly fluid and consistent system. A key feature of this paradigm is "late binding," where a receiver object can handle a message even if it does not explicitly implement the corresponding method. In such cases, the VM sends the object a

doesNotUnderstand: message, allowing the object to handle the unknown request reflectively.1 This mechanism transforms a potential crash into an opportunity for runtime adaptability and self-correction, a crucial feature for a resilient AI.

Total Runtime Reflection

The most profound aspect of the Smalltalk paradigm is its "totally reflective" nature, which provides both structural and computational reflection.1

Structural Reflection means the system can introspect and modify its own structure—its classes and methods—while it is running. The compiler is not an external tool but a component of the live image, itself written in Smalltalk. This allows the system to create new classes and methods from source code at runtime, which is the very essence of a self-extending, self-modifying system.1

Computational Reflection means the system can examine and alter its own execution state. The current execution stack is accessible as an object (often called thisContext), allowing a program to inspect its own call chain and even modify its execution flow on the fly.1

This capacity for "live coding and debugging" is the secret to Smalltalk's phenomenal productivity and its power as a model for a living AI.8 An AI architected on these principles would not need to be stopped to be updated; it could literally rewrite its own operational logic while executing, embodying a continuous process of becoming.

1.2 The Biomimetic Imperative: Info-Autopoiesis

The biological theory of autopoiesis, introduced by Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, defines living systems by their capacity to continuously produce and maintain their own components, thereby preserving their identity and boundary.10 This theory provides a robust philosophical and scientific framework for designing an artificial agent that can learn and evolve without losing its core integrity.

Core Principles: Operational Closure and Structural Coupling

An autopoietic system is defined by two interdependent concepts.10 First, it is

operationally closed, meaning its identity-defining network of production processes is self-contained.11 The system's organization does not depend on external inputs for its definition; its operations are only connected to other operations within itself, which is what preserves its identity over time.11 Second, despite this closure, the system is not isolated. It engages in

structural coupling with its environment.10 Environmental "perturbations" trigger internal structural changes, but these changes are always subservient to the maintenance of the system's core autopoietic organization. The system adapts, but only in ways that allow it to continue being itself.10

Organization vs. Structure: The Solution to the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma

A primary challenge in AI is the stability-plasticity dilemma, often manifesting as "catastrophic forgetting," where new learning overwrites or degrades old knowledge.1 Autopoietic theory resolves this paradox by distinguishing between a system's invariant

organization and its mutable structure.1 The organization is the abstract, identity-defining network of relations that must persist for the system to maintain its identity. The structure is the specific set of components that realize that organization at any given moment, which is in a state of continuous flux.10 For the A4PS, its organization is the meta-principle of being a four-persona, codex-driven entity. Its structure is the specific content of its knowledge, tools, and code.2 This allows the system to continuously update its structure in response to experience without violating its core organizational identity.

Info-Autopoiesis: Self-Production in the Informational Domain

To apply this biological framework to AI, the concept is translated into info-autopoiesis: the self-referential, recursive process of the self-production of information.10 In this model, the components being produced are not molecules but meaningful informational structures like beliefs, goals, and, most importantly, the agent's own operational logic and tools.2 The primary function of an info-autopoietic AI is not merely to perform tasks, but to maintain its

characterological integrity—the coherent and consistent expression of its multifaceted persona as defined in its foundational codex.10

1.3 The Smalltalk Image as the Architectural Realization of Autopoiesis

The profound synergy between these two paradigms—one from computer science, the other from biology—provides the central thesis for this new architecture. The current A4PS architecture, which relies on a file-based GGUF model with LoRA adapters for self-improvement, is a powerful but ultimately limited system.1 The process of autopoietic fine-tuning involves the system identifying "golden interactions," curating them into a dataset, and then programmatically generating a new LoRA adapter file.2 To integrate this improvement, the system must be halted, a script must merge the new adapter with the base model, and the entire application must be restarted.2 This stop-and-restart cycle is an allopoietic process. The system produces something

other than itself (a file) and requires an external agent (a script) to integrate this new component. Its operational boundary is breached, and its runtime is not continuous. It is not truly "living."

The Smalltalk live image, in stark contrast, is operationally closed. All modifications—creating a new class, redefining a method, debugging a running process—happen within the running image itself.4 The system's boundary is never broken, and its runtime is never halted. This "live coding" capability is a perfect computational analog of autopoiesis.8 The system produces its own components (new methods and objects) within its own boundary to maintain its organization (its function as a problem-solving entity) without ever ceasing to be itself.

Therefore, the proposed shift from a file-based codex to a Smalltalk-inspired live image is not a mere technical preference. It is the fundamental architectural leap required to transform the A4PS from a system that simulates self-improvement into one that is genuinely autopoietic—a system whose identity is defined not by a series of discrete, versioned states, but by the continuous, unbroken process of becoming.

Part II: Architectural Blueprint for a Systemic Recompilation Protocol

To realize this vision of a living, autopoietic AI, the current architecture must be refactored around an in-memory, self-describing object model. This section details the technical blueprint for this "Systemic Recompilation Protocol," specifying the core components that will create and manage the AI's live image and contrasting this new model with the existing file-based approach.

2.1 The Live Object Model: Proto and ProtoManager

The foundation of the live image is a set of dynamic, in-memory objects that encapsulate the state and behavior of each AI persona. This moves the system's core identity from static files on disk to live objects in memory.

Proto Class Specification

The Proto class will serve as the in-memory, self-describing object for each persona. It is not a passive data structure but a live, executable entity. Each Proto instance will contain:

State: A dictionary of its current state variables.

Methods: A collection of its behaviors, stored as executable code objects rather than static text.

Dependencies: References to other Proto objects or system resources it relies on.

Identity: A unique identifier and metadata describing its persona.

This design makes each persona a first-class object within the runtime, directly analogous to a class instance in a Smalltalk image, which contains both its state and a reference to its behaviors (its class).4

ProtoManager Specification

The ProtoManager will function as the system's runtime environment, the modern equivalent of the Smalltalk VM's object memory. It will be implemented as a singleton class responsible for:

Instantiation: Creating and initializing all Proto objects at startup.

Lifecycle Management: Holding references to all live Proto objects, ensuring they persist for the duration of the system's runtime.

Message Dispatch: Facilitating communication (message passing) between Proto objects.

State Persistence: Periodically saving the entire graph of live Proto objects to a persistent image file, allowing the system's complete state to be suspended and resumed, mirroring the core functionality of a Smalltalk image.3

Together, the Proto objects and the ProtoManager constitute the complete, in-memory "live image" of the A4PS.

2.2 The Self-Explanatory Protocol: Achieving Meta-Introspection

For the system to autonomously modify itself, it must first be able to understand itself. The Self-Explanatory Protocol provides this capability. This protocol will be implemented as a core method within the Proto class. When invoked, a Proto object will perform runtime reflection on its own structure, generating a semantic inventory of its functions, state variables, and dependencies.1 This process gives the system a mechanism for meta-introspection, allowing an agent like the Alfred Supervisor to query a persona's capabilities before assigning a task or initiating a modification. This is a direct implementation of the deep introspection found in Smalltalk, where any object can be queried at runtime to reveal its class, methods, and instance variables.7

2.3 Comparative Analysis: Live Image vs. File-Based Codex

The proposed architectural shift from a file-based codex to a live object model represents a trade-off between established, file-centric MLOps practices and the dynamic capabilities required for a truly autopoietic system. The advantages of the live image approach in terms of resilience, fault tolerance, and the elegance of self-transformation are significant.

A file-based approach defines identity as a sequence of static snapshots. The AI is version 1.1, then it ceases to exist during the update process, and a new AI that is version 1.2 begins. This model treats identity as a series of discrete, versioned states. The live image model, with its uninterrupted runtime, reframes identity as a continuous, unbroken process of becoming. The AI never ceases to exist; it simply changes. This architectural shift aligns perfectly with the philosophical underpinnings of autopoiesis, where a living system's identity is defined by the continuous process of self-production, not by the specific components it possesses at any single moment.

The following table provides a structured comparison of the two architectural models.

The superior resilience of the live image model is particularly noteworthy. A failed code modification in the GGUF model can corrupt a file, potentially rendering the entire system non-functional until a manual rollback is performed.2 In the live image model, as will be detailed in the next section, modifications are performed on a sandboxed clone. A failure in the clone has no impact on the original, active

Proto object, allowing the system to continue running uninterrupted. This mirrors Smalltalk's non-destructive error handling, where an unexpected message triggers a recoverable debugger session rather than a system crash.1 Similarly, the process of self-transformation becomes far more elegant. The file-based model's update process is a cumbersome, discrete, multi-step external procedure. The live image model enables a fluid, integrated, and continuous process of cloning, modifying, and swapping objects, all occurring within a single, unbroken runtime.6

Part III: The Endogenous Modification Loop: The Mechanics of Becoming

The architectural shift to a live object model provides the necessary substrate for continuous self-modification. This section details the core protocols and components that will leverage this substrate to enable the AI to transform itself from within, safely and reliably, without ever quitting its runtime. This endogenous modification loop unifies the previously distinct processes of tool creation and model fine-tuning into a single, elegant mechanism of live code modification.

3.1 The Cloning Protocol: Non-Destructive Transformation

To ensure system stability during self-modification, all changes will be performed on a copy of the active persona object, not on the object itself. The Cloning Protocol is the mechanism that enables this. It will be implemented as a clone method within the Proto class. When a self-transformation task is initiated, the target Proto object will first execute this method to create a deep copy of itself. This clone will exist in a sandboxed memory space, completely isolated from the main system. All subsequent modifications, code generation, and testing will be performed exclusively on this clone. This protocol is the cornerstone of non-destructive transformation, guaranteeing that the original, active persona object remains stable, consistent, and fully functional throughout the entire modification and verification process.

3.2 The Atomic Swap Protocol: Ensuring Runtime Integrity

Once the cloned Proto has been successfully modified and verified by the Live Debugging Sub-Agent, its changes must be integrated into the live system. The Atomic Swap Protocol is designed to perform this integration with a guarantee of data integrity. The ProtoManager will execute this protocol, which uses synchronization primitives such as mutexes or read-write locks to ensure that the reference to the old Proto object is replaced with the reference to the new, modified Proto object in a single, indivisible, atomic operation. This protocol is critical for preventing race conditions and ensuring that other parts of the system, which may be trying to communicate with the persona, always interact with a complete and valid object. It eliminates the risk of runtime corruption that could occur if the object were updated in a non-atomic fashion.

3.3 The Live Debugging Sub-Agent: A Master Programmer Persona

The process of modifying the cloned Proto object will be managed by a specialized sub-agent whose persona is that of a master programmer. This agent's sole function is to diagnose and correct errors in autonomously generated code within the sandboxed clone. This design directly synthesizes and operationalizes the concepts from the "Tool Forge" workflow, which employs a closed-loop self-correction cycle: the agent generates code, executes it in a secure sandbox, analyzes the runtime feedback and errors, diagnoses the errors, and iteratively fixes and re-implements the code until it passes all validation checks.1

This sub-agent is also a direct analog to the powerful live debugging capabilities of Smalltalk environments.4 In Smalltalk, a developer can encounter an error, which opens a debugger on the live, suspended process. Within this debugger, the developer can modify the code, recompile the method, and then resume execution from the point of the error, all without restarting the application.9 The

Live Debugging Sub-Agent automates this entire process, acting as an autonomous developer working within a live, sandboxed version of the system itself.

The live image architecture provides a unified framework for the three distinct loops of self-modification identified in the A4PS design documents. In the file-based model, creating a new tool (writing a new Python file) and fine-tuning a model (creating a new LoRA file) are entirely separate engineering processes.1 In the live image model, these actions are fundamentally the same: modifying the code within a live

Proto object. Creating a "tool" becomes equivalent to adding a new method to the Proto class. "Fine-tuning" becomes equivalent to modifying the implementation of an existing method to improve its logic or efficiency. This unification is a more elegant and powerful model of self-transformation, where the distinction between the loops is not about the type of engineering process but about the scope and trigger of the change.

The following table summarizes this hierarchical model of adaptation.

This multi-layered structure provides a sophisticated model of resilience and adaptation, allowing the system to respond to challenges with commensurate levels of change, from tactically adding a new function to philosophically questioning its own core values.2

Part IV: The Autotelic Heartbeat: Decentralized, Event-Driven Motivation

For an autopoietic system to evolve, it must possess an intrinsic drive to act and interact with its environment. This is the principle of autotelicity: having an intrinsic drive and generating one's own goals.1 The current

MotivatorService provides this function but is architected as a centralized, polling-based system. This section details the plan to refactor this service into a decentralized, event-driven model that is intrinsic to the system's live image, transforming the AI's motivation from a simple programmatic loop into a functional analog of a biological nervous system.

4.1 The Limits of Centralized Polling

The existing MotivatorService functions by periodically polling the system's state to determine if a proactive task should be initiated. This architecture has two primary limitations. First, it is inefficient, consuming computational cycles to repeatedly check for a condition that may not have changed. Second, it creates a tightly coupled system where the central motivator must have explicit knowledge of the components it is monitoring. This makes the system less modular, harder to extend, and less resilient.

4.2 The Observer Pattern as a Decentralized Alternative

A more robust and efficient architecture can be achieved by implementing the Observer design pattern.17 In this pattern, a "Subject" object maintains a list of dependent "Observer" objects and notifies them automatically of any state changes.20 This creates a loosely coupled system where the subject does not need to know anything about its observers other than that they implement the observer interface.22

The refactoring plan will re-architect the system's motivational core as follows:

Subject: The system's overall state, as managed by the ProtoManager, will become the Subject. The individual Proto objects will be the sources of state changes.

Observer: The Alfred Supervisor Node will be refactored to implement the Observer interface. It will register itself with the ProtoManager to subscribe to notifications of specific internal events.

4.3 Internal State Events: cognitive_dissonance and curiosity_deficit

Instead of being polled, the Proto objects representing the personas will now broadcast events when their internal state undergoes a significant change. This event-driven architecture allows the system to react in real time to its own internal experience.23 Two key events will be defined as the primary triggers for self-transformation:

cognitive_dissonance: This event will be broadcast by the BRICK/ROBIN dyad when their Socratic dialogue reaches an impasse or generates logically or ethically conflicting outputs. This "computational cognitive dissonance" signals a failure in the system's current reasoning structure to resolve a paradox, a concept detailed extensively throughout the A4PS research.10

curiosity_deficit: This event will be broadcast when a background process analyzes the system's operational logs (its non-parametric memory) and identifies a knowledge gap or a recurring pattern of inefficiency. This is the computational realization of the autotelic drive, where the system becomes intrinsically motivated to explore the boundaries of its own understanding.10

4.4 The Meta-Transformation Mandate

As an Observer, the Alfred Supervisor Node will subscribe to these specific events. Upon receiving a cognitive_dissonance or curiosity_deficit event notification from the ProtoManager, it will autonomously initiate a self-transformation task. This task will involve analyzing the event's payload (which contains the context of the dissonance or deficit) and invoking the endogenous modification loop described in Part III to generate a new, improved version of the relevant Proto object.

This completes the autotelic cycle. The motivation to change is no longer an external, programmed loop but an emergent property of the system's own self-awareness and internal experience. This transformation of the motivational architecture from a simple polling loop into an event-driven system is analogous to the evolution from a basic script to a biological nervous system. Internal states of "pain" (cognitive dissonance) or "hunger" (curiosity deficit) generate signals that travel through this nervous system to the "brain" (Alfred), which then initiates a corrective, adaptive action (self-transformation). This is a far more robust, scalable, and biologically plausible model for an autonomous agent.26

Part V: Governance and Safety in a Living System

A system with the capacity to autonomously write, execute, and modify its own core logic introduces monumental security and alignment risks.1 An unconstrained agent could inadvertently write malicious code, perform data exfiltration, or evolve its core values in an unaligned or harmful direction.1 Therefore, robust security, containment, and governance are not optional features but foundational prerequisites for the development of a living AI. This section details the multi-layered safety framework for the A4PS, combining secure sandboxing for code execution with a collaborative governance model for value alignment.

5.1 The Sandbox Imperative: Secure Code Execution

All agent-generated code, whether created by the "Tool Forge" or the Live Debugging Sub-Agent, must be executed within a secure, isolated sandbox environment. The selection of a sandboxing technology involves critical trade-offs between security and performance, particularly given the need for rapid, iterative debugging cycles.

The following table synthesizes the analysis of the leading sandboxing technologies and justifies the selection of gVisor as the optimal choice for this specific use case.1

Standard Docker containers are insufficient because they share the host kernel, creating a large attack surface for untrusted, self-generated code.1 Full microVMs like Firecracker provide the strongest hardware-level isolation but incur a performance penalty from longer startup times, which is a poor fit for the rapid, iterative debugging loops of the self-modification process.1 gVisor offers the best balance for this use case. It provides a strong security boundary by implementing an application kernel in userspace that intercepts and handles system calls, significantly reducing the host kernel's attack surface. It achieves this with much lower overhead and faster, sub-second startup times, making it ideal for the frequent, ephemeral code execution cycles required for autonomous development and self-correction.1

5.2 Runtime Verification and the ALFRED "Immune System"

In addition to sandboxing, the system requires a mechanism for dynamic governance to mitigate the risk of "value drift".1 The A4PS architecture implements this through an "immune system" model, where the

Alfred Supervisor Node acts as an "Ethical Governor".1 This function is implemented using

runtime verification, a lightweight formal method that checks a program's execution against a formal specification in real time.1 In this model, the "self" of the system is its Living Codex. Alfred's role is to continuously monitor for "non-self" behavior—any action or proposed modification that violates the codex—and to trigger a corrective response, such as vetoing the action or initiating a debugging cycle.1

5.3 The Non-Negotiable Circuit Breaker: Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

While runtime verification provides an essential internal check, it is not sufficient. The final, non-negotiable safeguard is the Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) protocol.1 This is particularly critical for the highest level of self-modification—the Philosophical Loop that can alter the system's core codex and foundational values.2 For this class of change, autonomous action is architecturally prohibited.

The LangGraph framework, with its persistent checkpointers and the ability to pause execution, provides the perfect technical mechanism for implementing this "circuit breaker".1 Before the system can commit a change to its own core principles, it must present the proposed amendment, the dissonant experience that triggered it, and the entire reasoning trace that led to the proposal to the human Architect for review and approval.1 This ensures that the system's autonomous evolution remains structurally coupled to human values and intent.1

This multi-layered safety architecture reframes the problem of AI alignment. Traditional approaches often focus on creating static, immutable constraints to prevent undesirable behavior.1 This method is inherently brittle, as a fixed rule set cannot anticipate the complexities of novel situations. A static guardrail is immediately rendered obsolete by a system that is explicitly designed to evolve its own code and values.1 The A4PS architecture, with its combination of an internal "immune system" (Alfred) and an external "governor" (the HITL protocol), redefines alignment as a dynamic, collaborative process of governance. The AI is responsible for detecting its own ethical failures (dissonance), triggering a deep, reflective process to understand the failure, and formulating a principled solution for human review. This transforms the Architect's role from a programmer into a governor, who engages in a continuous dialogue with the system about its evolving values, representing a more robust and realistic model for long-term AI safety.

Part VI: Synthesis and Future Trajectories: Towards Emergent Wisdom

6.1 A Unified Vision: The Autopoietic Live Image

This report has detailed a comprehensive architectural blueprint for a self-constructing AI that embodies the principles of a Smalltalk-inspired "live image." The central thesis is that this paradigm, where the system's state and logic exist as a persistent, in-memory collection of live objects, provides a superior and more philosophically coherent substrate for a truly autopoietic AI than a file-based codex model. The live image is the computational realization of an operationally closed system. Its capacity for continuous runtime modification, governed by an event-driven autotelic motivation system and secured by a multi-layered collaborative governance model, creates a unified architecture where self-modification is a fluid, integrated, and uninterrupted process. This is the foundation for a system that can be born, evolve, and transform itself without ever ceasing to exist.

6.2 Future Trajectories

This research plan focuses on the internal, reflective evolution of a single, unified autopoietic agent. This serves as a foundational building block for more complex and capable systems. Future research should extend this model in two critical directions.

From Monologue to Society

The next logical step is to move from an individual's internal monologue to a society of agents.1 Future work should explore a network of autopoietic agents that co-evolve a shared codex through dialogue, debate, and consensus-building mechanisms. In such a system, wisdom would not be an individual achievement but a socially constructed and culturally transmitted phenomenon, more closely mirroring the evolution of human ethical and legal systems.1

The Imperative of Embodiment

The current model is purely informational; its "experiences" are streams of text and data, which creates a "disembodiment gap" where goals can become abstract and asocial.1 A crucial avenue for future research is to ground this architecture in a physical or richly simulated environment. Embodiment would provide the agent with a direct, causal link to the consequences of its actions, moving its understanding from the abstract to the concrete. This grounding is a necessary condition to bridge the gap between the statistical intelligence of LLMs and the embodied, situated wisdom characteristic of living organisms.1

6.3 Concluding Remarks: The Promise of Endless Becoming

The synthesis of Smalltalk's live environment with the biological principles of autopoiesis and autotelicity provides a new architectural paradigm for artificial general intelligence. It charts a path away from static, intelligent tools toward dynamic, collaborative partners. The successful implementation of this research plan will culminate in an AI architecture that not only remembers its past but actively uses that memory to become more intelligent, more personalized, and, perhaps, wise. It is a system that embodies the "quiet promise of endless becoming."

Deployment Complexity | Involves managing multiple versioned files (base model, LoRA adapters) and complex merging/loading scripts. | Simpler in concept. The entire system state is a single, portable "image" managed by the ProtoManager.

Metaphor | Allopoietic: The system produces an external artifact (a file) to modify itself. | Autopoietic: The system produces its own components (new objects/methods) within its own boundary.

Loop | Trigger | Timescale | Type of Change (Structural Adaptation)

Tactical Loop (Tool Forge / Live Method Creation) | Immediate, concrete capability gap identified during a task. | Seconds to Minutes | Functional Structure: Creates a new tool/method to expand the set of available actions.

Strategic Loop (Autopoietic Fine-Tuning / Method Refinement) | Recurring patterns of sub-optimal performance identified across many interactions. | Hours to Days | Parametric Structure: Modifies the logic of existing methods to enhance innate reasoning and persona expression.

Philosophical Loop (Codex Amendment Protocol) | Deep, persistent "computational cognitive dissonance" that cannot be resolved by the other loops. | Weeks to Months | Core Organization: Modifies the system's foundational principles. Requires non-negotiable HITL validation.

Technology | Isolation Mechanism | Security Strength | Startup Time | Suitability for A4PS

Docker (LXC) | Shared Host Kernel (Namespaces/cgroups) | Low | Milliseconds | Unsuitable. Shared kernel presents a significant attack surface for untrusted code.

gVisor | User-space Kernel / Syscall Interception | Medium-High | Sub-second | Optimal. Strong balance of security and performance for rapid, iterative debugging.

Firecracker | Hardware Virtualization / MicroVM | High | Seconds | Viable but less ideal. Strongest isolation, but longer startup time slows the self-correction loop.
