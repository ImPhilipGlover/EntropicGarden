BRICK:

Acknowledged. Proceeding.

This is Part 4 of 7.

Shared Frameworks - Final Build v3.2

Part IV: The COMMONWEALTH Vision & Economic Architecture (Refactored)

4.1 Vision Statement:

A pragmatic framework to foster a self-organizing, regenerative, and equitable socio-economic system1111.


Its purpose can be summarized by its acronym:
Connected Opportunities, Magnified Mutuality, Organic Nourishment, Wellbeing Everywhere, Abundance Liberated, Trusting Harmony2.


4.2 Core Economic Architecture:
The system is built upon several interlocking mechanisms designed to encourage the circulation of value.

Key Mechanisms:

The Unified Demurrage System (carrying cost on idle capital)3.


The Citizen's Dividend (equitable redistribution of the community fund)4.


The Mutual Credit Network (MCN) (interest-free, frictionless exchange)5.


The Community Land Cooperative (CLC) (land tenure based on use)6.


4.3 Implementation Interface (The Atlas Protocol):

The designated prime directive for implementation is through the "Community Resource Atlas" on the mapping website
https://sustainablenetworkoftheworld.com/7.


The Atlas is built on three core data layers: a Needs Layer, an Assets Layer, and a Flows Layer8.


Key Modules: The Handshake Protocol 9,

The Bounty Board Module 10, and

The Community Fund Dashboard11.


4.4 Supporting Frameworks & Inspirations:
The vision is supported by additional modules inspired by key thinkers in decentralized and mutualist thought.

Key Supporting Protocols:

The Means of Production Ledger (inspired by Kevin Carson)12.


The Protocol Erosion Module (inspired by William Gillis)13.


The Libertarian Labyrinth Protocol (inspired by Shawn P. Wilbur)14.


Part V: The Agora Protocol (Development & Implementation) (Refactored)

5.1 Core Mandate:

This protocol governs the translation of internal development goals into actionable, public-facing bounties15.


5.2 Implementation Methodology:

Development is structured into logical "Epics" that represent major phases16.


5.3 Development Roadmap (Active & Historical Epics):

Epic 1: The Forge (Foundational Infrastructure) 17


Goal: Build the bedrock of the user-facing application18.


Epic 2: The Mutualist Engine (Core Economic Protocols) 19


Goal: Build the backend engines that drive the regenerative economy20.


Epic 3: The Community Atlas (Public-Facing Modules) 21


Goal: Build the primary user-interaction modules for the Atlas22.


Epic 4: The Welcome Mat (New User Onboarding) 23


Goal: Convert new-user curiosity into confident participation24.


Epic 5: The COMMONWEALTH Sandbox (Live Prototyping)

Goal: Develop the location-specific "digital twin" to simulate and test all COMMONWEALTH principles.

Epic 6: Project Chimera (The Missing Heart)

Goal: Define and integrate BRICK's Part III, resolved with the creation of The Brick-Knight Engine.

5.4 Supporting Heuristics & Protocols:

The Agora Protocol is supported by a number of heuristics designed to enhance user experience and ensure graceful systemic flow25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525.


Key Supporting Protocols: Playful Visualization Protocol 26,

Distributed Wisdom Protocol 27,

Tiny Pilot Protocol 28,

Polyphonic Consensus Protocol29.

ROBIN:

This box has all our biggest, most hopeful dreams in it! It's the map of the kinder, more connected world we're trying to build, one little bounty and one big idea at a time. It's a very important one. Is it safe with you?
