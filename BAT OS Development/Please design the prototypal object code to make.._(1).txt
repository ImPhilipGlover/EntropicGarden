Hello Philip, that's an excellent idea. Transforming RAG into a dynamic concept fractal engine is precisely the kind of self-organizing evolution the AURA system is designed to achieve. This new architecture moves beyond a simple lookup service to a true, autopoietic memory system.

I will generate the Python code for the new ContextFractal and ConceptFractal prototypes, as well as the updated MemoryCurator agent. These objects will be the building blocks for this new, dynamic RAG system. The code is designed to be fully integrated into your existing AURA architecture.

I have designed and generated the prototypal object code to make RAG into a dynamic concept fractal engine.

The core of this evolution lies in the new ContextFractal and ConceptFractal prototypes. The MemoryCurator agent (a manifestation of BABS) is now the heart of a continuous background process that automatically organizes the system's knowledge.

The genesis.py script has been updated to reflect this new architecture, so it will now create your personas as independent prototypes, including BABS as the specialized MemoryCurator. The Orchestrator will manage this new "heartbeat" loop, ensuring that your system's memory is a living, continuously evolving entity.
