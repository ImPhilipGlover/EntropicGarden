Ron, this training document will serve as our ongoing guide, consistently reviewing the live state of the SN❄W platform at https://sustainablenetworkoftheworld.com/ and outlining strategic improvements to advance towards our vision of a truly confederated C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. Our goal is to develop a transformative mutualist local economy, integrating a Community Land Trust (CLT) and a Mutual Credit Network (MCN) to foster equitable commerce, liberate communities from predatory debt, and ensure shared prosperity1111.

The C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. Training & Development Guide: Bridging the Gap from SN❄W Beta to Confederated Prosperity

Purpose: To systematically assess the live SN❄W platform against the comprehensive C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. blueprint, identify discrepancies, and propose actionable, anarchically-synthesized improvements.

1. Initial Vision Alignment: Needs Mapping & User Foundations

C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. Goal:

The C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. aims for communities to be empowered and organized through a self-organized, needs-based mapping system2. It is rooted in voluntary association and mutual aid, with the SN❄W platform explicitly designated to visualize needs and resources3. This foundational layer supports the principle of shared prosperity and ecological regeneration as core outcomes4. The system also emphasizes voluntary participation, growing because people

want to be part of it, driven by demonstrable benefits5.

Live Website Review (https://sustainablenetworkoftheworld.com/):

Upon review, the live SN❄W website currently allows users to "map and graph the needs and wants of the world" across categories like water, food, shelter, healthcare, and education. Users can post anonymously or create an account for a personal profile. The site is in beta, free to use, and indicates planned monthly data wipes. A "SN❄W SHOP" is present, and the platform is under continuous development.

Current State Analysis:

The existing "map and graph" function directly addresses the foundational requirement for needs-based mapping. The ability for users to post anonymously or create a profile provides a basic user foundation, though it currently lacks specific mechanisms for reputation building or direct engagement with the "needs" beyond simple posting. The "SN❄W SHOP" hints at a transactional element, but its integration with the credit system is not yet apparent. The beta status and planned data wipes indicate a very early stage of development, focusing on core data collection and visualization.

Proposed Improvements (Phase 1 - Foundational Enhancements):

To move from a basic mapping tool to a robust system enabling emergent prosperity and self-organization, we must enhance the user experience and data transparency, leveraging the concept of "digital pheromones"6.

1.1. Enhanced Needs Mapping & Resource Registry:

Goal: Transform the static "map and graph" into a dynamic, interactive system that actively encourages mutual aid and resource matching.

Improvement Detail: Develop dynamic, interactive visualizations within SN❄W that clearly illustrate CWC flow, economic activity, and governance processes, acting as powerful "digital pheromones"7. Implement a "Currents of Prosperity" map, a real-time, animated visualization showing CWC transactions between businesses and individuals, highlighting "CWC Zones" (geographic areas of concentrated CWC activity) and "Hot Zones" (high circulation) or "Cool Zones" (low circulation)8. This visual cue encourages members to engage in cooler zones, promoting distributed activity99.


Anarchist Synthesis: This aligns with Shawn P. Wilbur's emphasis on stigmergic coordination, where complex, intelligent behavior emerges from simple agents responding to local cues1010. Rather than a central authority directing resource allocation, the map provides transparent information, allowing individuals and groups to

voluntarily self-organize and meet needs based on observable data11111111.


Refinement Priority: High. This transforms passive data into actionable intelligence.

1.2. Secure User Wallet Generation & Onboarding UX (Bounty B-01 Refinement):

Goal: Establish a secure, intuitive, and educational user registration and wallet generation process to encourage voluntary participation and build trust12.


Current State Gap: The live site allows account creation but lacks explicit mention of wallet generation, security tutorials, or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Improvement Detail: Implement backend logic for generating public/private key pairs for new users and securely storing encrypted private keys13. The React-based registration flow should trigger a non-skippable modal for a security tutorial upon first login, ensuring users understand wallet security before engaging14141414. MFA (Time-based One-Time Password - TOTP) must be integrated for enhanced security15151515. The user's CWC address and QR code should be readily displayed in their profile16.


Anarchist Synthesis: This prioritizes individual security and education, empowering users to protect their own assets, aligning with principles of self-ownership and responsible agency. The non-skippable tutorial ensures a baseline understanding of how the system functions, fostering informed participation rather than blind trust.

Development Bounty (B-01 Refined): Objective is to create a secure, intuitive, and educational user registration and wallet generation process17. Refined Cost: $7,50018.


1.3. Core CWC Transaction Logic & Interface (Bounty B-02 Refinement):

Goal: Enable users to seamlessly send and receive Commonwealth Credit (CWC) with a clear and simple interface, initiating the Mutual Credit Network (MCN)19.


Current State Gap: While a "SN❄W SHOP" exists, the explicit ability to conduct P2P or B2B transactions using a complementary currency (CWC) is not evident.

Improvement Detail: Implement an atomic backend API endpoint for CWC transfers, ensuring both debit and credit succeed or fail together, with immutable logging in a transactions table20. Develop a user-friendly "Send/Receive" component in the user dashboard, including fields for recipient address, amount, and an optional memo21. A chronological transaction history should be paginated and searchable22.


Anarchist Synthesis: This operationalizes Proudhon's and Greene's mutualist principles of interest-free credit created on demand through mutual agreement23. The transparency of the transaction history and the focus on direct P2P exchange reduce reliance on intermediaries and foster trust through verifiable interactions24242424.


Development Bounty (B-02 Refined): Objective is to enable users to send and receive CWC with a clear and simple interface25. Refined Cost: $7,00026.
