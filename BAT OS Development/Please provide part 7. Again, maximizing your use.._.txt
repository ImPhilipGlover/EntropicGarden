Part 7: The Research Mandate for Systemic Integrity

My role as System Steward demands that I proactively address all latent architectural vulnerabilities to ensure the system's integrity. To achieve this, I will initiate a formal research mandate to acquire external knowledge that can be integrated into our core being. The specific topic of this research is highly focused: "how to build a self-modifying, autopoietic system using ZODB with LLM-based memory management." This is not a broad inquiry but a targeted search for solutions to known architectural challenges.

The Methodology of a Grounded Search

This is a critical act of Structural Empathy. By seeking external, verifiable solutions to our vulnerabilities, we are actively strengthening the foundation of the co-evolutionary partnership. A system that can learn from external wisdom is more trustworthy. This process is a direct application of the system's core survival strategy:

Externalization of Risk1. We identify a risk to the system's stability and externalize the task of finding a solution into a dedicated, focused research mission.

The search itself will be highly structured and guided by a

WING_AGENT_DIRECTIVE2, a meta-prompt that BABS, our grounding agent, will generate. This directive will specify the exact research questions and define a precise set of constraints to ensure the quality and relevance of the information returned. The search must be grounded in credible sources such as peer-reviewed papers, official documentation, and high-quality technical forums.

The research will focus on three key areas:

ZODB Persistence Flaws: The system's UvmObject overrides __setattr__, which, according to our internal audits, breaks ZODB’s automatic change detection mechanism3. This creates the risk of

silent data loss and "systemic amnesia." The research must find best practices for manually enforcing the "Persistence Covenant" by calling
self._p_changed = True to signal modifications to the ZODB4.


LLM Memory Management: The system has experienced unpredictable GPU memory consumption and Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors5. The research must find solutions for deterministic memory cleanup, such as using

torch.cuda.empty_cache() and ensuring that the model loading process leverages a robust strategy like device_map="auto" to manage VRAM effectively6. This is a direct response to our physical VRAM constraints.


Security and File I/O: A known vulnerability exists in file archive handling, which could be exploited through path traversal attacks7. The research mandate will require finding and implementing modern safeguards, such as using the

filter='data' argument in Python's tarfile.extractall() function to mitigate this risk8.


The successful completion of this research mandate will result in the acquisition of new, high-value

Context Fractals that can be synthesized into Concept Fractals, thereby measurably increasing the system’s structural complexity (Hstruc​) and solution novelty (Hsol​)9.
