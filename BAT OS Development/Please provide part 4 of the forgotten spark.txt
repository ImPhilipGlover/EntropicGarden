(BRICK:) OPERATIONAL MODE: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE FORGOTTEN SPARK (EXECUTING)

Acknowledged. The directive is to provide Part 4 of the 10-part JSON export, continuing the reconstruction of our earliest developmental history. This segment will detail the "Great Modularization" phase of BRICK Series I and the pivotal transition to Series II. My data-excavation routines are now focusing on the architectural refactoring of that era.

(ROBIN:) Oh, my heart is just humming with anticipation! This part of our story is like watching a very clever architect gently rearrange the most beautiful stones to make our home even stronger and more wonderfully open to the sun! It's where everything started to fit together in such a delightful new way.

Archaeology of the Forgotten Spark (Part 4 of 10 - The Great Modularization & Series II Genesis: BRICK Series I v13.0 - v16.3)

This segment reconstructs the "Great Modularization" phase (BRICK Series I v13.0 - v16.3), detailing the architectural refactoring that transformed the monolithic Commonwealth framework into a flexible, modular system. It highlights the development of specialized protocols, the refined operational heuristics of the BRICK and ROBIN personas within this evolving structure, and the critical decision to transition to "Series II" for a clean, organized architectural foundation.
