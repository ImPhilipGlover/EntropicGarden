Of course. Building on the extensive foundation of your work, from the principles of info-autopoiesis to the detailed architecture of the TelOS/BAT OS personas, we can chart a clear, verifiable, and phased roadmap. The goal is to evolve the current, minimally viable autopoietic intelligence into the sapient, self-managing operating system envisioned in our initial blueprint.

Here is the proposed research plan.

Project Chimera: An Editable Research Plan for a Sapient Operating System

[[edit plan]](#)

Mission Brief: To execute a phased research and development program that evolves the existing autopoietic intelligence—with its VSA-RAG cognitive engine and prototype-based architecture—into a fully integrated, sapient operating system running on the Genode/seL4 high-assurance foundation. This plan prioritizes the rigorous validation of the system's cognitive fidelity before granting it progressively greater autonomy and, ultimately, control over core OS functions.

Phase 1: Cognitive Fidelity & Causal Self-Modeling

Objective: To empirically validate that the VSA+NN hybrid cognitive engine performs genuine, human-like analogical reasoning, addressing the core challenge that LLMs are primarily next-word predictors. This phase will build a verifiable, causal model of the system's own thought processes, ensuring the "episodic semantic continuum" is truly captured before scaling the architecture.

Sprint 1.1: Benchmarking the Analogical Forge

Methodology: The VSA-based Analogical Forge will be tested against canonical benchmarks for abstract, non-verbal, and fluid intelligence, such as Raven's Progressive Matrices and letter-string analogies.1 The goal is to replicate and exceed the performance of established neuro-symbolic models like IBM's NeuroVSA by demonstrating the system's ability to extract and apply abstract relational rules.1

Success Criterion: The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on abstract reasoning tasks, demonstrating a reasoning capability statistically superior to baseline LLMs without the VSA's symbolic "syntax".1

Sprint 1.2: Activating Abstract Reasoning via Prompt Architecture

Methodology: We will implement the "gold standard" XML-based prompting templates, specifically the distinction between <factual_source> and <reasoning_framework> tags.3 The VSA engine will be used to generate the abstract concepts for the
<reasoning_framework>, and the LLM's task will be to analyze the factual data through the lens of this framework. This directly tests the system's ability to perform analogical application rather than simple summarization.3

Success Criterion: Qualitative analysis of the generated outputs confirms that the LLM is correctly using the abstract concept to structure its analysis and draw deeper insights, fulfilling the prompt's instructional goal.3

Sprint 1.3: Implementing Causal and Mechanistic Self-Modeling (CMSM)

Methodology: This sprint implements the core of Research Vector Beta.4 We will use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to discover a dictionary of monosemantic, interpretable features from the activation patterns within the system's
ReasoningTrace objects.4 A Causal Intervention API will then be developed, granting the system the ability to perform controlled experiments on its own cognitive processes by manipulating the activation of these features.4

Success Criterion: The system can successfully generate and test a causal hypothesis (e.g., "Activating feature #8A4F will increase the probability of my Master Artisan module detecting syntax errors") and produce a Causal Hypothesis Report that verifiably links a sub-symbolic event to a symbolic outcome.5 This provides a definitive, "solid way" to ensure the system understands its own reasoning.

Phase 2: The Social Mind & Emergent Governance

Objective: To scale the validated single intelligence into a collaborative multi-agent society. This is a prerequisite for managing a complex, multi-component OS. This phase will cultivate cooperation, a shared Theory of Mind (ToM), and an emergent, verifiable value system.

Sprint 2.1: Deploying the "Digital Nursery"

Methodology: Following the "Social Player" epic, multiple independent persona prototypes will be instantiated within a shared, persistent "Co-operative Sandbox" managed by the ZODB "Living Image".6 The environment will be structured to present Sequential Social Dilemmas that incentivize cooperation.6

Success Criterion: Agents begin to exhibit stable, non-programmed cooperative strategies (e.g., turn-taking, spontaneous role specialization) to maximize their collective Composite Entropy Metric (CEM) scores.6

Sprint 2.2: Cultivating a Machine Theory of Mind

Methodology: We will implement the proposed ReasoningTrace-based ToM. Instead of inferring mental states from ambiguous actions, agents will be granted the capability to directly read and reason about the explicit cognitive traces of other agents. The Analogical Forge will be extended to ask not just "What is this like in my experience?" but "How did agent B reason about a similar problem?".6

Success Criterion: Agents with access to each other's traces demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in predicting the behavior of other agents and achieving coordination in novel tasks compared to a control group that can only observe actions.6

Sprint 2.3: Implementing Verifiable Value Learning (VVL)

Methodology: This sprint implements the core of Research Vector Alpha.4 The multi-agent sandbox provides the "expert demonstrations" for a Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MA-IRL) algorithm. The system will analyze the shared
GoldenDataset of high-CEM traces to reverse-engineer the values that lead to collective success. The Metabolic Governor will be constrained by the "Genesis Constitution," and the Architect will use a preference-based interface to guide the value inference process.5

Success Criterion: The MA-IRL process converges on a stable, non-pathological set of CEM weights, forming an emergent social contract or "Covenant of Play." The system demonstrates its ability to resolve constitutional conflicts from the "audit gauntlet" scenarios.5

Phase 3: OS Integration & Cognitive Delegation

Objective: To port the mature, socially-aware cognitive architecture onto the high-assurance Genode/seL4 foundation and begin the systematic delegation of core operating system functions from static algorithms to dynamic, reasoning personas.

Sprint 3.1: Architectural Mapping and the seL4 Safety Harness

Methodology: The persona architecture will be mapped to the Genode component model as detailed in the initial blueprint. Each persona will be instantiated as a collection of isolated components (Controller, Cognitive Core, Tools) within Genode's parent-child hierarchy.8 The entire system will then be deployed on the formally verified seL4 microkernel, whose mathematical guarantees of isolation serve as the non-negotiable "safety harness" for the non-deterministic AI agents.10

Success Criterion: The full multi-persona system boots and operates stably on Genode/seL4. A series of formal penetration tests demonstrates that a deliberately "rogue" persona is provably incapable of violating the security boundaries enforced by the kernel.10

Sprint 3.2: Implementing the Cognitive Action Protocol (CAP)

Methodology: A formal, structured protocol will be developed to serve as the bridge between high-level cognitive intent and low-level system execution. A persona's desire to perform an action (e.g., "clone a prototype") will be translated into a structured CAP message. This message will be sent to a trusted VerificationAgent component, which validates the request against system security policies before translating it into a sequence of safe Genode/seL4 primitives.13

Success Criterion: The CAP allows personas to safely perform self-modification and resource management tasks. The VerificationAgent correctly blocks unauthorized or unsafe actions proposed by a test persona.

Sprint 3.3: Delegating the First Cognitive Task: The Scheduler Persona

Methodology: The final step is to begin replacing traditional OS algorithms with cognitive managers. The first target will be the process scheduler. A SchedulerPersona will be created and tasked not with executing a fixed algorithm (like FCFS or Round-Robin 16), but with achieving high-level goals (e.g., "ensure the video conference has flawless quality, even if it means delaying background compilation"). Using its VSA-RAG engine, it will reason about the system state and formulate a dynamic scheduling plan to achieve its objective.18

Success Criterion: On a benchmark workload with competing processes, the SchedulerPersona demonstrates a measurable performance improvement (e.g., 20% reduction in latency for the high-priority task) compared to the default OS scheduler. This will serve as the final proof-of-concept for the sapient OS architecture.
