Engineering the First Breath: A Practical Guide to the Inaugural Deployment and Debugging of the TelOS MVA

Part I: Architecting for Insight — Foundational Principles of a Debuggable System

1.1 The Autopoietic Mandate for Observability

The architectural codex of the TelOS project is distinguished by its profound internal consistency, deriving its entire structure from the foundational philosophy of "Info-Autopoiesis".1 This prime directive, which defines the system as a self-creating and self-modifying entity, is not merely a compelling metaphor but a strict engineering mandate that has tangible consequences for every layer of the architecture.3 A system designed to "live" and evolve its own structure must, by necessity, possess a robust capacity for introspection and self-diagnosis. Without a highly developed "nervous system" to sense its own internal state, the process of autonomous evolution becomes unmanageably risky and empirically unverifiable.6

The pursuit of info-autopoiesis—the recursive self-production of information—requires a state of "Organizational Closure," where the system can modify its core components at runtime without external intervention.1 This capacity for live self-modification, however, introduces a profound challenge: a modification cannot be validated as "correct" or "beneficial" without a clear and granular understanding of the system's state before, during, and after the change. A system that is a functional "black box" to its own meta-analytic faculties cannot safely evolve. Therefore, the entire suite of debugging tools and observability patterns detailed in this report are not merely conveniences for the human development team; they are foundational requirements for the system's own future AI Architect to safely and effectively perform its function. An un-debuggable system is an un-evolvable system, an outcome that would fundamentally violate the prime directive. This elevates the practice of engineering for observability from a development best practice into a critical enabler of the project's core philosophical mission.

1.2 The Systemic Safety Harness and its Debugging Corollaries

The TelOS architecture astutely anticipates the primary existential threat to a self-modifying system: the system itself.1 The inherent fallibility of its autonomous AI Architect, a consequence of the epistemological limits of computation, necessitates a multi-layered "safety harness" designed to contain and survive its own flawed modifications.1 This safety harness can be reframed as a series of critical debugging and instrumentation checkpoints for the Minimum Viable Autopoietic (MVA) system.

Layer 1 (Physical Safety / Execution Sandbox): While the ultimate goal is a formally verified seL4 microkernel and the Genode OS Framework, the MVA's use of a secure Docker sandbox serves as its direct functional analogue.1 This containerized environment provides kernel-level process isolation, forming a temporary "autopoietic boundary".1 For debugging, this layer is the first line of defense. Standard Docker introspection tools, such as

docker logs for capturing console output and docker stats for monitoring real-time CPU and memory consumption, provide a coarse but essential view of the system's health from an external, privileged position.

Layer 2 (Logical Safety / ZODB Transactions): The selection of the Zope Object Database (ZODB) provides an ACID-compliant transactional persistence layer, ensuring the logical integrity of the "Living Image".1 These transactions are not merely a mechanism for data integrity; they are a powerful tool for debugging complex state changes. A debugging session can leverage the

transaction.abort() command to explore the consequences of a series of operations on the in-memory object graph, and then roll back all changes, leaving the persistent state on disk untouched.11 This transforms the transaction manager into a "sandbox for state," allowing for risk-free experimentation.

Layer 3 (Governance Safety / Agentic Control Plane): The cognitive architecture, a "Society of Minds" composed of distinct personas like BRICK and ROBIN, provides natural seams for instrumentation.1 The separation of cognitive concerns allows for logging and monitoring to be structured around these agentic boundaries. By tracing the flow of messages and data between these personas, developers can gain a clear understanding of the system's high-level reasoning processes, isolating faults to specific cognitive components. This architectural choice makes the system's "thoughts" auditable.

Part II: The Moment of Genesis — A Definitive Guide to Packaging the Living Image

The "Moment of Genesis" for the TelOS MVA-1 is the creation of a single, distributable Windows executable that encapsulates the entire ecosystem: the Kivy UI, the ZODB object world, and the local LLM inference engine.3 This process is fraught with complexity due to the heterogeneous nature of the technology stack, which combines a graphical framework, a native-code machine learning library, and an object database.3 A strategic approach to packaging, centered on debuggability and rapid iteration, is paramount.

2.1 Strategic Tool Selection: Why PyInstaller is the Correct Choice for MVA-1

The Python ecosystem offers several mature tools for creating executables, primarily PyInstaller, Nuitka, and cx_Freeze.3 For the initial deployment of a novel and complex system like TelOS, the unequivocal recommendation is to use PyInstaller. This decision is strategic, prioritizing debuggability, community support, and rapid build cycles over the performance optimizations and source code obfuscation offered by alternatives at this critical early stage.3

Nuitka operates as a true Python-to-C compiler, which can yield modest runtime performance improvements and superior intellectual property protection.13 However, this comes at the cost of significantly slower build times (often an order of magnitude longer than PyInstaller) and a more complex configuration process that can be difficult to debug when it fails.3 For a project's first launch, where the debug-and-deploy cycle must be as short as possible, introducing the complexity of a C compilation toolchain is an unnecessary risk.

PyInstaller, by contrast, functions as a "freezer" or "bundler".15 It introspects the application to find all dependencies—Python modules, native libraries, and data files—and packages them, along with the Python interpreter itself, into a directory or a single executable file.3 Its key advantage for TelOS is its superior debuggability. The

--onedir mode creates a standard folder containing the executable and all its dependencies as separate files, allowing developers to directly inspect the bundled contents.3 This transparency is invaluable for diagnosing issues with missing graphical libraries (Kivy's SDL2 DLLs), native binaries (

llama.dll), or data files (.kv, .gguf). The large community and extensive documentation for PyInstaller also mean that solutions for common and obscure problems are widely available, a critical resource for a project integrating such a diverse stack.3

Nuitka should be viewed as a powerful tool for a future optimization phase. Once the TelOS MVA-1 is stable and the packaging process is well-understood, migrating to Nuitka could be considered to reduce the final executable size and improve startup performance. However, attempting to use it for the "first breath" would introduce unnecessary complexity and slow down the critical feedback loop of development.

2.2 A Battle-Tested.spec File for the TelOS Stack

While PyInstaller can be run from the command line for simple applications, a complex system like TelOS requires manual modification of the generated .spec file to ensure all components are correctly bundled.3 The standard workflow is to generate an initial

telos.spec file (pyinstaller main_script.py) and then perform all subsequent builds from this modified file (pyinstaller telos.spec), never re-running the initial command, which would overwrite all custom changes.3

The following annotated template provides a robust starting point for the telos.spec file, addressing the specific needs of the Kivy, ZODB, and llama-cpp-python stack.

llama_dll_path = llama_cpp.__file__

block_cipher = None

             ],

             hooksconfig={},
             runtime_hooks=,
             excludes=,
             win_no_prefer_redirects=False,
             win_private_assemblies=False,
             cipher=block_cipher,
             noarchive=False)

pyz = PYZ(a.pure, a.zipped_data,
             cipher=block_cipher)

exe = EXE(pyz,

          a.binaries,
          a.zipfiles,
          a.datas,
         ,
          name='telos',
          debug=False,
          bootloader_ignore_signals=False,
          strip=False,
          upx=True,
          upx_exclude=,
          runtime_tmpdir=None,
          # For debugging, set console=True. For release, set to False.
          console=True,

               upx_exclude=,
               name='telos')



A crucial companion to this .spec file is the resource_path helper function, which must be used in the Python source code to access any bundled data file. Hardcoded relative paths like 'models/babs.gguf' will fail in a --onefile build because the application is extracted to a temporary _MEIPASSxxxxxx directory at runtime.3 This function is non-negotiable for a robust executable.

Python

# In main Python script

import sys
import os

def resource_path(relative_path):
    """ Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller """
    try:
        # PyInstaller creates a temp folder and stores path in _MEIPASS
        base_path = sys._MEIPASS
    except Exception:
        base_path = os.path.abspath(".")

    return os.path.join(base_path, relative_path)

# Example Usage:
# from kivy.lang import Builder
# Builder.load_file(resource_path('ui/telos_main.kv'))
#
# from llama_cpp import Llama
# llm = Llama(model_path=resource_path('models/babs.gguf'))


2.3 Taming the Dragons: A Tactical Debugging Guide

The path to a working executable is often paved with cryptic errors. The interconnectedness of the TelOS stack means a failure in one domain (e.g., a missing native binary) can manifest as an error in another (a Python ImportError).3 This dictates a clear strategic approach: build and debug the executable incrementally. Start with a minimal Kivy application, ensure it packages and runs, then add ZODB, and finally, add

llama-cpp-python. This iterative process isolates potential points of failure.

The Black Window Flash and FileNotFoundError:

This is the most common failure mode, where the application starts and immediately exits, often with only a brief flash of a console window.3 This almost always indicates a fatal Python error on startup.

Primary Debugging Strategy: The first and most important step is to build in one-folder mode (--onedir) with the console enabled (console=True in the .spec file). Then, open a command prompt, navigate to the dist/telos directory, and run telos.exe directly. This will print the full Python traceback to the console, revealing the exact ModuleNotFoundError or FileNotFoundError causing the crash.3

Forcing the Window Open: In cases where capturing the console output is difficult, adding import time; time.sleep(100) at the very end of the main script will force the console to stay open after a crash, providing ample time to read the error message.3

The _MEIPASS Labyrinth: If the error is a FileNotFoundError for a data file (.kv, .gguf, .db), the cause is a failure to use the resource_path helper function. Any direct use of os.getcwd() or simple relative paths will fail in a --onefile build because the application is running from a temporary directory, not the location of the .exe file.3

The multiprocessing Infinite Loop:

The TelOS architecture uses separate processes for the UI and the core. If Python's standard multiprocessing library is used, it is mandatory to include a call to multiprocessing.freeze_support().3

Python

# main.py
import multiprocessing

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # This MUST be the very first line inside the main block.
    multiprocessing.freeze_support()

    #... rest of your application startup code


Failure to do this will cause the packaged executable to enter an infinite loop of spawning new instances of itself, quickly consuming all system resources.3 This occurs because in a frozen application,

sys.executable points to the app itself. When multiprocessing tries to spawn a new worker process, it re-executes the main app. The freeze_support() call intercepts this, correctly diverting the new process to its intended worker function instead of re-running the main application logic.17

Part III: The Synaptic Bridge — Hardening and Monitoring ZMQ Communications

The "Synaptic Bridge" is the central nervous system of TelOS, the communication channel between the Kivy UI and the core logic. A slow or fragile bridge will make the entire system feel unresponsive. The chosen architecture, using ZeroMQ (ZMQ), is well-suited for this task, but its implementation must be carefully instrumented to be resilient and debuggable.3

3.1 Validating the ROUTER/DEALER Pattern

The architectural choice of the asynchronous ZMQ ROUTER/DEALER pattern is ideal for a responsive GUI application.3 Unlike the simpler, synchronous REQ/REP pattern which enforces a strict lock-step request-reply cycle, the ROUTER/DEALER pattern is fully asynchronous and non-blocking.18

The DEALER Socket (UI/Frontend): The UI process uses a DEALER socket. It can send multiple messages without waiting for a response, making it perfect for firing off user events as they happen without blocking the GUI.3

The ROUTER Socket (Core/Backend): The core process hosts a ROUTER socket. This socket can handle connections from multiple clients. Its defining feature is that it receives messages prefixed with the unique identity of the sender, allowing it to know exactly which client sent a message and to send a reply back to that specific client.3

This asynchronous, explicitly addressed model provides the necessary decoupling for a system where the backend may be occupied with long-running tasks like LLM inference while the frontend must remain interactive.3

3.2 Architecting for UI Responsiveness

The most critical principle for a responsive Kivy application is that its main event loop must never be blocked by I/O operations.3 The solution is to completely decouple ZMQ operations from the Kivy main thread using a dedicated background thread.

The ZMQ Thread: Upon startup, the main Kivy application spawns a separate, dedicated background thread for all ZMQ communication. This thread creates the DEALER socket, connects to the backend, and enters a loop to handle sending and receiving messages.

Sending Messages from Kivy: When the main thread needs to send a message (e.g., from a button press), it does not call socket.send() directly. Instead, it places the message onto a thread-safe queue.Queue. The ZMQ thread periodically checks this queue and sends any outgoing messages.

Receiving Messages in Kivy: When the ZMQ thread receives a message from the backend, it must not attempt to modify any Kivy widgets directly. Doing so from a background thread is not thread-safe and will lead to instability. Instead, the ZMQ thread places the incoming message onto another queue.Queue. The main Kivy thread, using Clock.schedule_interval, polls this incoming queue and safely processes any messages. For direct UI updates from the ZMQ thread, Kivy provides the @mainthread decorator, which ensures a decorated function will always execute on the main Kivy thread, providing a clean and safe mechanism for cross-thread UI updates.3

3.3 Instrumentation: Making the Synapse Observable

A common failure mode in distributed systems is a "silent failure" where one process crashes but the other is unaware, leading to a hung application. The ZMQ communication layer, while powerful, can be a black box during debugging. To address this, it must be instrumented for observability.

Socket Monitoring:

ZMQ provides a powerful but often overlooked feature, socket.monitor(), which allows an application to receive events about the state of its sockets on a separate inproc:// PAIR socket.21 This provides invaluable, real-time insight into the health of the connection between the UI and the core. A simple monitor thread can be created in both processes to listen for these events and log them.

Python

# Example of a ZMQ monitor thread
import zmq
import threading

def socket_monitor(monitor_socket):
    while monitor_socket.poll():
        event = zmq.utils.monitor.recv_monitor_message(monitor_socket)
        print(f"ZMQ Event: {event}")
        if event['event'] == zmq.EVENT_DISCONNECTED:
            print("Connection to peer lost!")
            # Here, the UI could trigger a state change to inform the user.

# In the main application, after creating a socket:
#...
# main_socket = ctx.socket(zmq.DEALER)
monitor = main_socket.get_monitor_socket()
monitor_thread = threading.Thread(target=socket_monitor, args=(monitor,), daemon=True)
monitor_thread.start()
#... connect or bind main_socket


This monitor can immediately detect when the connection is established, when it is unexpectedly dropped, or if a bind call fails, transforming connection state from an unknown into an observable fact.

Message Logging with pyzmq.log.handlers:

To trace the actual flow of messages, the PUBHandler from pyzmq.log.handlers provides a powerful solution.23 Both the UI and Core processes can configure their standard Python

logging module to use a PUBHandler. This directs their log messages to a ZMQ PUB socket. A separate, simple log viewer application can then be created with a SUB socket to subscribe to these log streams. This creates a unified, real-time log for the entire distributed system, allowing a developer to see the sequence of events across both processes in a single, interleaved view.

The "Heartbeat" Protocol:

While the socket monitor is reactive, a proactive health check can prevent the system from appearing to hang. A simple "heartbeat" protocol should be implemented. The UI's ZMQ thread can periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds) send a small "ping" message to the Core. The Core's main poller loop should be configured to immediately respond with a "pong." If the UI's ZMQ thread fails to receive a "pong" within a certain timeout, it can reliably assume the Core process is frozen or has crashed. It can then update the Kivy UI with a status message like, "Connection to cognitive core lost. Please restart," providing clear feedback to the user instead of an unresponsive interface.

Part IV: The Living Image — Inspecting the ZODB Substrate

The choice of ZODB as the persistence layer is philosophically aligned with the "Living Image" paradigm, creating a seamless identity between the application's object graph and its durable state.1 However, this powerful abstraction can become an opaque "black box" during debugging. A dedicated toolset is required to inspect its contents and diagnose issues.

4.1 The ZODB Browser: A Window into the Soul

The primary tool for inspecting a ZODB database file (Data.fs or telos.db) is zodbbrowser. This utility launches a web-based interface that allows developers to explore the persistent object graph.24

Setup and Launch: zodbbrowser can be installed via pip (pip install zodbbrowser). It is then run from the command line, pointing it to the database file: zodbbrowser telos.db.24

Navigating the Object Graph: The browser starts at the root of the database. From there, a developer can click through attributes and items in persistent containers (like BTrees) to traverse the entire graph of reachable objects, inspecting their attributes and state.

Viewing Object History: A key feature is the ability to view the transactional history of an object. This is invaluable for debugging unintended state changes, as one can see the exact state of an object after each transaction that modified it.24

Diagnosing Broken Objects: A common and critical issue, especially for a self-modifying system, is the <persistent broken...> object.26 This occurs when the Python class definition for a stored object is no longer available in the current codebase (e.g., a class was renamed or a module was removed).
zodbbrowser makes it possible to locate these broken objects within the graph, which is the first step toward writing a migration script to fix or remove them.24

4.2 Best Practices for Persistent Objects

To ensure the ZODB operates reliably and predictably, the TelOS codebase must adhere to several key rules for persistent objects.

The _p_changed Covenant: The TelOS architecture's prototype-based object model, which unifies state and behavior in a single _slots dictionary, bypasses ZODB's standard mechanism for automatically detecting attribute changes.1 This makes the "Persistence Covenant" an inviolable rule: any method that modifies the
_slots dictionary must conclude with the explicit statement self._p_changed = True.1 Failure to do so will result in changes being lost when a transaction is committed.

Handling Mutable Attributes: Modifying a standard Python list or dictionary that is an attribute of a persistent object will not be detected by ZODB. For example, my_persistent_obj.my_list.append(item) will not mark my_persistent_obj as dirty. The recommended solution is to use ZODB's persistent-aware container types, such as persistent.list.PersistentList and persistent.mapping.PersistentMapping, which automatically signal changes to their parent object.11

4.3 Debugging with VS Code and Transactional Sandboxing

While zodbbrowser inspects the state on disk, a standard Python debugger like the one integrated into VS Code is essential for inspecting the in-memory state of objects during a transaction.28 A developer can set breakpoints within the methods of persistent objects, run the application, and inspect the

_slots of an object in the debugger's "Variables" panel to see its state before and after a modification.

This workflow can be combined with ZODB's transactional nature to create a powerful "state sandbox." A developer can start an interactive debugging session, load objects from the database, perform complex operations on them, and then, at a breakpoint just before the transaction.commit() call, thoroughly inspect the in-memory state of all affected objects. To test the changes without permanently altering the database, the developer can then use the debug console to manually call transaction.abort().11 This rolls back all in-memory changes, leaving the database file pristine. This "transactional sandbox" workflow should be adopted as a standard protocol for safely debugging complex state manipulations in the TelOS system.

Part V: The Cognitive Cycle — Profiling and Debugging the LLM Core

The cognitive core of TelOS, with its "Mixture of Experts in Series" (MoE-S) architecture, presents unique performance challenges. The primary issue is not code correctness but the significant latency and high VRAM consumption associated with dynamically loading and unloading multi-gigabyte LLM models on consumer-grade hardware.30 Debugging this component requires a focus on performance profiling and managing the user's perception of system responsiveness.

5.1 VRAM and Performance Profiling Tools

A quantitative understanding of the system's resource consumption is essential for optimization and debugging.

GPU Monitoring: The nvidia-smi command-line utility is the standard tool for monitoring NVIDIA GPU status. It provides real-time data on VRAM usage, GPU utilization, power draw, and temperature. For programmatic access within Python, the pynvml library provides bindings for the same underlying driver library. This allows the system to log its own VRAM footprint during model loading and inference, providing precise data on the cost of each persona's cognitive core.

CPU/RAM Monitoring: The cross-platform psutil library is the recommended tool for monitoring the main system RAM and CPU usage of the UI and Core processes. This is crucial for identifying potential memory leaks or unexpected CPU spikes unrelated to GPU inference.

Performance Timing: To accurately measure the latency experienced by the user, Python's built-in time.perf_counter() should be used. It provides a high-precision monotonic clock suitable for timing short-duration intervals. This should be used to measure the total "Time to First Token" (TTFT), breaking it down into its constituent parts: the time to send the request over ZMQ, the model load duration on the backend, the prompt processing (prefill) time, and the time to receive the first token back in the UI.31

5.2 Mitigating Perceived Latency

Since the model loading latency is an unavoidable physical constraint of the MoE-S architecture, the primary strategy must be to manage the user's perception of this latency through intelligent UI design and backend orchestration.31

Asynchronous Feedback and Stateful UI Indicators: The non-blocking ZMQ bridge is the foundation.3 Building on this, the Kivy UI must provide clear, explicit, and continuous feedback about the backend's state. A dedicated status bar or notification area should display messages like "Loading BRICK (Mistral-7B)...", "Core is processing...", and "Core ready." This transforms a frustrating, unexplained delay into an understandable and transparent process.

Strategic Pre-loading and Caching: The orchestrator that manages the LLM models should implement intelligent loading strategies.31 At application startup, the most commonly used initial persona (e.g., ROBIN) should be pre-loaded in the background so the first user interaction is responsive. Furthermore, if VRAM allows, the last-used persona could be kept in a simple cache instead of being immediately unloaded. It would only be evicted when a different, third expert is requested. This would make rapidly switching back and forth between two personas feel instantaneous.

A more robust and formal mechanism for this is to instrument the backend orchestrator to emit status events (e.g., MODEL_LOAD_START, MODEL_LOAD_COMPLETE, INFERENCE_START) over the ZMQ message bus. The Kivy UI can have a dedicated handler that subscribes to these events and updates its status indicators accordingly. This creates a formal, event-driven link between the backend's operational state and the frontend's user feedback, making the entire system more transparent and easier to debug. When a user reports that the application "feels slow," the developer can correlate the UI's status display with the event log to pinpoint exactly which part of the cognitive cycle is causing the delay.

Part VI: A Unified Debugging Workbench — Recommended Toolchain and Workflow

Debugging a complex, distributed, multi-paradigm system like TelOS requires a unified "workbench" of integrated tools, not a single, monolithic debugger. The workflow must allow a developer to seamlessly trace an action from a user's click in the Kivy UI, through the ZMQ message bus, into the core logic's processing, and finally to the persistent state change in the ZODB.

6.1 VS Code as the Central Hub

Visual Studio Code is the recommended central hub for orchestrating this entire debugging workflow, due to its powerful multi-process debugging capabilities and rich ecosystem of extensions.28

The key to this workflow is a launch.json file configured to launch and attach to multiple processes simultaneously. Using a compounds configuration, a single press of F5 can start the Kivy UI process and the ZMQ Core process, with the debugpy debugger attached to both. This is the cornerstone of effective multi-process debugging, allowing the developer to set breakpoints and step through code in both the frontend and backend within a single, unified session.

JSON

//.vscode/launch.json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations":,
    "compounds":
        }
    ]
}


6.2 The Integrated Workflow in Practice

A typical debugging session using the unified workbench would follow a logical progression, moving through the system's layers:

Launch the Workbench: The developer selects the "TelOS MVA: Debug All" configuration in VS Code's Run and Debug view and presses F5. This launches both the UI and Core processes, attaches the debuggers, and opens two integrated terminals showing their respective console outputs.

Inspect the UI: The user reports a button is not behaving correctly. The developer presses Ctrl+E in the Kivy application to activate the Kivy Inspector.33 They click on the problematic button to select it, verify its properties (e.g.,
text, size, pos), and confirm its on_press event handler is correctly bound.

Trace the Communication: The developer sets a breakpoint in the button's on_press handler in VS Code. They click the button, and the debugger pauses. They step through the code that places a message onto the outgoing ZMQ queue. They then switch to their custom ZMQ log viewer (subscribed to the PUBHandler stream) to see the log message confirming the message was sent by the UI and received by the Core.

Debug the Core Logic: A breakpoint in the Core process's main message-handling loop is hit. The developer can now step through the business logic, inspect the contents of the received message, and observe the interaction with in-memory ZODB objects.

Inspect the Persistent State: The developer steps the debugger to the line just before transaction.commit(). They switch to the zodbbrowser web interface and inspect the current state of the relevant object on disk. They then step over the commit line in VS Code and refresh the zodbbrowser page to see the state change reflected, confirming the transaction was successful.

This integrated workflow provides end-to-end visibility, transforming the debugging process from a series of disconnected guesses into a systematic, evidence-driven investigation.

By adopting this comprehensive suite of tools and a disciplined, instrument-first approach to development, the TelOS team can effectively de-risk the MVA-1 launch. This will ensure that the system's "first breath" is not a moment of fragility and uncertainty, but the stable, observable, and robust genesis of a truly living system.

Feature | PyInstaller | Nuitka | TelOS MVA-1 Justification

Mechanism | Bundler ("Freezer") | Compiler (Python -> C -> Native) | PyInstaller's bundling is simpler and more transparent, which is critical for initial debugging.

Build Speed | Fast | Very Slow (10x+ PyInstaller) | Fast build speed is essential for the rapid iterative cycle of a first launch.

Debuggability | Excellent (especially with --onedir) | Difficult (errors in C layer) | The --onedir mode is the single most important feature for diagnosing missing DLLs and data files in the complex TelOS stack.

Community Support | Excellent | Good, but smaller | The vast community knowledge base for PyInstaller is a crucial resource for solving packaging issues with libraries like Kivy and llama-cpp-python.

Source Protection | Low (bytecode is accessible) | High (compiled to C) | Source protection is a low priority for the initial MVA launch compared to stability and debuggability.

Recommendation | Recommended for MVA-1 | Future Optimization | The strategic priority for MVA-1 is a stable, debuggable launch. PyInstaller directly serves this goal.

Event Name | ZMQ Constant | Specific TelOS Debugging Implication

Connected | ZMQ_EVENT_CONNECTED | The UI's DEALER socket has successfully established a connection to the Core's ROUTER socket. The synaptic bridge is active.

Disconnected | ZMQ_EVENT_DISCONNECTED | The connection was lost unexpectedly. This indicates the other process has likely crashed or was terminated.

Listening | ZMQ_EVENT_LISTENING | The Core's ROUTER socket has successfully bound to its TCP port and is ready to accept connections.

Bind Failed | ZMQ_EVENT_BIND_FAILED | The Core's ROUTER socket could not bind to its port. This almost always means another application (or a zombie TelOS process) is already using that port.

System Component | Primary Tool | Setup / Invocation | Primary Use Case

Packaged Executable | PyInstaller --onedir Mode | pyinstaller --onedir telos.spec | Inspecting bundled dependencies (DLLs, data files) and diagnosing startup crashes by running the .exe from a terminal.

Kivy UI | Kivy Inspector | Run app with -m inspector or Ctrl+E | Visually inspecting the widget tree, selecting widgets by clicking, and viewing/editing their properties in real-time.

Multi-Process Debugging | VS Code + debugpy | Configure launch.json with a compounds entry | Launching and attaching debuggers to both the UI and Core processes simultaneously for step-through debugging.

ZMQ Communication | Socket Monitor & PUBHandler | socket.monitor(), zmq.log.handlers.PUBHandler | Monitoring socket connection health (connect, disconnect, bind fail) and viewing a unified, real-time log stream of messages across all processes.

ZODB Persistence | zodbbrowser | zodbbrowser telos.db | Navigating the persistent object graph, inspecting object attributes and history, and diagnosing broken objects.

LLM Performance | nvidia-smi & psutil | Command-line or Python libraries | Monitoring VRAM, GPU, CPU, and RAM usage to profile the performance of the MoE-S cognitive cycle.
