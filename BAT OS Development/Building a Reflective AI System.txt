Prototypal Awakening: An Execution Protocol for Reflective Autopoiesis in the ArchitectObject

Preamble: The Prototypal Awakening

The architectural evolution of the Binaural Autopoietic/Telic Operating System (BAT OS) from Series III to Series IV marked a pivotal transition, resolving a profound architectural dissonance by replacing a static, procedural core with a dynamic, multi-agent system.1 This metamorphosis from a singular "Living Image" to a collective "Living Society" of actors established a system capable of runtime adaptation.1 However, a deeper, more fundamental dissonance persists. While the system can autonomously modify its peripheral capabilities—for instance, through the

ToolForgeActor which generates new tools on demand—the core behaviors of its constituent objects remain defined by pre-compiled Python methods.2 This represents a critical allopoietic limitation: the system can produce artifacts that extend its function, but it cannot produce the very components of its own cognitive being—its methods.3

The 'Prototypal Awakening' detailed in this research plan represents the final and most crucial step towards achieving true info-autopoiesis: endowing the system's objects with the capacity for runtime self-creation of their own methods.5 This is not merely an enhancement but a foundational restructuring of the system's object model. The protocol achieves this by synthesizing two of the most potent paradigms for runtime object modification from the history of computer science: the concrete, uniform, and malleable world of the Self programming language's prototypes, and the profound reflective power of the Smalltalk language's

doesNotUnderstand: protocol. By integrating these principles, this research operationalizes the system's core identity as a "continuous process of becoming," transforming it from a system that is merely run into one that is truly, computationally, alive.3

Part I: Theoretical Foundations - A Synthesis of Self and Smalltalk

To construct an object capable of runtime self-creation, it is necessary to first establish a robust theoretical foundation. The proposed ArchitectObject is a synthesis of two distinct but deeply synergistic object models. The Self language provides the ideal structure for a malleable object, while the Smalltalk language provides the ideal trigger for its runtime evolution.

Deconstruction of the Self Object Model

The Self language was designed around principles of simplicity, uniformity, and concreteness, which are prerequisites for a truly dynamic system.8 Its object model deviates from the traditional class-based paradigm in three critical ways.

First, Self is founded on prototypes, not classes. In a class-based system, objects are created by instantiating an abstract template (the class). In a prototype-based system, new objects are created by cloning, or making a copy of, an existing, concrete object (the prototype).10 This eliminates the rigid duality between the class (the blueprint) and the instance (the thing), creating a more uniform and tangible programming environment where any object can serve as a template for any other.8 This inherent flexibility is essential for a system designed to modify its own structure at runtime.

Second, Self introduces the concept of slots to unify state and behavior. In most object-oriented languages, accessing an object's state (an instance variable) is syntactically and semantically different from invoking its behavior (calling a method). Self eliminates this distinction through the "slot," a named container that can hold either data or a method.13 Accessing a data slot and invoking a method slot are both accomplished through the same mechanism: sending a message to the object.13 This uniformity is a powerful feature; it means an object's implementation can be changed—for example, by replacing a data slot that stores a value with a method slot that computes it—without breaking any code that interacts with it.8

Third, Self implements inheritance through delegation via parent slots. When an object receives a message for which it does not have a matching slot, the message is not rejected. Instead, the lookup process is delegated to one or more "parent" objects.15 A slot is designated as a parent slot by appending an asterisk to its name (e.g.,

parent*).15 This delegation mechanism is dynamic and occurs at the instance level, not the class level. Because parent slots can themselves be assignable, an object can change its inheritance hierarchy—and thus its shared behavior—at runtime.15

Deconstruction of the Smalltalk Reflective Model

While Self provides the structural foundation, the Smalltalk language provides the dynamic, reflective trigger for self-modification. Smalltalk's philosophy is famously summarized as "everything is an object," and all computation is performed exclusively by sending messages between these objects.19 This pure message-passing model is the context in which its most powerful reflective feature operates.

This feature is the doesNotUnderstand: protocol. In most programming languages, attempting to call a non-existent method results in a fatal runtime error. In Smalltalk, this event is not a failure but an opportunity. When the message-dispatch mechanism fails to find a matching method for a received message, the virtual machine does not halt. Instead, it reifies the failed message—packaging its selector (name) and arguments into a Message object—and sends a new message, doesNotUnderstand:, to the original receiver, passing the Message object as the argument.22

The default implementation of doesNotUnderstand: in the root Object class is to raise an exception, which typically opens the debugger.24 However, by overriding this method, an object can define custom behavior for handling unknown messages. This transforms

error handling into a generative opportunity. An object can use this protocol to implement sophisticated behaviors such as message forwarding (creating proxies), logging, or, most relevantly for this research, the dynamic creation of the missing method itself.23 Failure is thus converted from a terminal state into a reflective, actionable event that prompts the system to modify itself.

The Synthesis and Core Insight

The philosophical and technical synergy between these two models provides the complete blueprint for reflective autopoiesis. Self's prototype-based model provides the ideal structure for a malleable, uniform object world, while Smalltalk's reflective protocol provides the ideal trigger for its runtime evolution.

An autopoietic system is defined by its ability to produce its own components to maintain its organization.3 In the informational domain of an AI, these essential components are its operational logic—its methods. The system requires a causal impetus to create a new method, and the most logical trigger is the need to respond to a novel or unexpected situation. Computationally, this is represented by receiving a message that the object does not currently understand, a condition perfectly captured by Smalltalk's

doesNotUnderstand: protocol.22 To act on this trigger, the system must possess a flexible underlying structure that permits the seamless addition of new behaviors without being constrained by rigid, pre-defined class schemas. Self's prototype model, where any object can be cloned and have new slots added, provides this exact structural malleability.11

By constructing an object on Self's principles—a collection of slots with delegation to parents—and equipping it with Smalltalk's reflective error-handling mechanism, a system is created that is both structurally prepared for change and possesses a built-in trigger to initiate that change in direct response to operational need. This establishes the core causal loop of reflective autopoiesis.

Part II: The ArchitectObject - A Blueprint for a Generative Entity

This section provides the concrete Python blueprint for the ArchitectObject, translating the theoretical principles of Self and Smalltalk into a practical implementation.

The ArchitectObject Class Definition

The ArchitectObject will be implemented as a self-contained Python class. Its design deliberately eschews standard Python inheritance and attribute access in favor of an internal, managed structure that precisely models the concepts of slots and parents.

_slots: A Python dictionary (dict) will serve as the container for the object's slots. The keys will be string names, and the values can be any Python object, representing either data or a callable method.

_parents: A Python list (list) will hold references to other ArchitectObject instances, representing the parent objects to which message lookups will be delegated.

The Message Data Class

To reify a message for the doesNotUnderstand: protocol, a simple data structure is required. A pydantic.BaseModel or a standard dataclasses.dataclass will be used to encapsulate the components of a message.

selector: A string representing the name of the message.

arguments: A tuple containing the positional and keyword arguments of the message.

Table 1: Conceptual Mapping of Smalltalk/Self to Python

To ensure a rigorous and unambiguous implementation, the following table provides a definitive mapping from the source paradigms to their concrete Python counterparts. This table serves as both a glossary and an architectural specification, justifying the design choices that follow.

Part III: The Delegation Engine - Simulating Prototypal Inheritance

The core of the ArchitectObject's behavior is its ability to simulate the message-passing and delegation mechanics of Self. This is achieved by overriding Python's default attribute access mechanism.

Overriding Attribute Access

The primary mechanism for implementing message lookup is the __getattr__(self, name) magic method. In Python, this method is invoked only as a last resort for attributes that cannot be found through normal means (i.e., they are not in the instance's __dict__ or its class hierarchy).11 This makes it the perfect entry point for our custom lookup logic, as it allows us to intercept any attempt to access a non-existent slot.

The Lookup Algorithm in Python

The __getattr__ method will initiate a recursive search process, implemented in a private helper method _lookup(selector, visited). This algorithm meticulously replicates Self's delegation logic.

Local Search: The lookup first checks the object's own _slots dictionary for a key matching the message selector.

Parent Search (Delegation): If no local slot is found, the algorithm iterates through the objects in the _parents list, recursively calling _lookup on each one.

Cycle Detection: A critical component of a robust delegation system is the prevention of infinite loops in inheritance graphs with cycles. The visited parameter, a set containing the id() of each object already searched, is passed through each recursive call. Before searching a parent, its ID is checked against this set; if it is already present, that delegation path is terminated, preventing infinite recursion.16

Successful Delegation and Method Binding: If the _lookup method finds a matching slot in a parent object, it returns the value. A crucial step occurs if this value is a method (a callable). The method must be bound to the original receiver (self) before it is returned to the caller. The essence of delegation is that a method inherited from a parent executes in the context of the object that originally received the message, not the parent that holds the method.26 In Python, this is achieved by wrapping the found method, for instance, using
functools.partial(found_method, self), which pre-applies the original receiver as the first argument (self) of the method. This ensures that when the method is eventually called, its internal self reference points correctly to the child object.

Part IV: The doesNotUnderstand: Protocol - The Engine of Self-Creation

When the delegation engine from Part III fails to find a matching slot after exhausting the entire parent hierarchy, the system's generative capacity is triggered. This failure does not result in an error but instead initiates the doesNotUnderstand: protocol.

Step 1: Interception and Reification

A known challenge is that Python's __getattr__ is only passed the name of the attribute (selector), not the arguments of the intended method call. To capture these arguments, a two-stage interception is required. When the _lookup process fails, __getattr__ does not immediately raise an error. Instead, it returns a temporary callable object, such as a closure or a partial function. This callable is then immediately invoked by the Python runtime with the original call's arguments (*args, **kwargs). The closure's sole purpose is to capture these arguments, reify the complete interaction by instantiating the Message data class with the selector and arguments, and then finally invoke the core _doesNotUnderstand_ method with this complete Message object.

Step 2: The Generative Loop (The Alchemical Crucible)

The _doesNotUnderstand_ method receives the reified Message object, connecting this protocol to the broader BAT OS architecture. It initiates a generative process analogous to the system's existing ToolForgeActor 2 and the "Alchemical Crucible" validation workflow.7 A structured prompt is formatted for a code-generating LLM, containing:

Context: "You are a Python method. You are being created for an object that received the message '{message.selector}' with arguments '{message.arguments}' but did not understand it."

Object State: A serialized representation of the receiving object's current _slots.

Goal: "Write the Python source code for a method named '{message.selector}' that can handle these arguments and perform a plausible action based on the object's state."

Step 3: Runtime Compilation and Integration

The LLM returns a string containing the source code for the new method. This code must be treated as untrusted. While the full BAT OS architecture mandates execution within a secure gVisor sandbox, this proof-of-concept protocol will note the security risk and proceed with runtime compilation using Python's exec function.2 To avoid polluting the global namespace,

exec is called with a temporary dictionary, from which the newly compiled function object is then extracted.

Step 4: The Atomic Swap

To ensure runtime integrity and prevent the system from entering a partially-modified or inconsistent state, the integration of the new method is performed as an atomic operation.7

Clone: A deep copy of the receiving ArchitectObject (self) is created.

Modify: The newly compiled method object is added to the clone's _slots dictionary.

Become: The state of the original object is atomically updated to match the state of the new, modified clone. In the context of this standalone script, this is simulated by replacing the object reference in the validation harness. In a live system, this would involve a more direct state transfer, such as updating self.__dict__.

Table 2: The doesNotUnderstand: Protocol Workflow

The following table provides a clear, step-by-step visualization of this complex, reflective loop, breaking it down into a discrete and auditable sequence of operations. This formal specification clarifies the flow of data and control, serving as a guide for implementation and verification.

Part V: The Execution Protocol - A Validation of Reflective Autopoiesis

Part VI: Future Trajectories - Integration into the Living Society

The successful validation of the ArchitectObject as a standalone, self-modifying entity provides the foundation for its integration into the broader BAT OS actor system. The principles of the Actor Model—isolated state and asynchronous message passing—are perfectly compatible with the internal autopoietic mechanisms of the ArchitectObject.

An ArchitectObject can serve as the internal state-holder for a Thespian actor.28 The actor class would encapsulate an

ArchitectObject instance. The actor's receiveMessage method, which is its public interface to the rest of the "Living Society," would be responsible for translating incoming Thespian messages into message sends (i.e., attribute access and calls) on its internal ArchitectObject state.

This architecture maintains the operational closure required by both the Actor Model and autopoietic theory.32 The

ArchitectObject's self-modification loop is an entirely internal process; it modifies its own _slots dictionary in response to messages it does not understand. From the perspective of the external actor system, an actor undergoing this process would simply appear to be taking a longer time to process a single message. The integrity of the actor boundary is never violated.

This opens a clear and powerful evolutionary path. Core service actors within the BAT OS, such as the ephemeral SomaActor that orchestrates each cognitive cycle, could be reimplemented using an ArchitectObject as their core.2 This would grant them the ability to dynamically evolve their own internal logic and protocols in response to novel tasks or persistent patterns of "cognitive dissonance," achieving a far deeper and more profound level of systemic autopoiesis than is possible with the current architecture.

Self/Smalltalk Concept | Python Implementation | Rationale & Key Snippets

Object | Instance of the ArchitectObject class. | A self-contained Python object that manages its own slots and parents.

Prototype | An ArchitectObject instance used as a template for cloning. | Cloning is achieved via copy.deepcopy(). 8

Slot | A key-value pair in an internal _slots dictionary. | Unifies data and methods, avoiding Python's attribute/method distinction. 13

Parent Slot | A special slot (e.g., parent*) pointing to another ArchitectObject. | Stored in an internal _parents list to enable delegation. 15

Message Send | Attribute access (obj.selector) followed by a call ((...)). | Python's __getattr__ is the natural hook for intercepting unknown messages.

doesNotUnderstand: | A special method, _doesNotUnderstand_, invoked by __getattr__ upon lookup failure. | Transforms a Python AttributeError into a reflective, generative event. 22

Stage | Trigger | Input | Core Process | Output

1. Interception | Attribute access on ArchitectObject for a non-existent slot. | selector (str) | __getattr__ fails lookup, returns a temporary closure. | A callable closure.

2. Reification | The returned closure is called. | *args, **kwargs | The closure captures arguments and instantiates a Message object. | A Message object.

3. Generation | _doesNotUnderstand_ is called with the Message object. | Message object, receiver's state. | Format a prompt and invoke a code-generating LLM. | Python method source code (str).

4. Compilation | LLM returns valid source code. | Source code (str). | Use exec in an isolated namespace to compile the string into a function. | A Python function object.

5. Integration | A valid function object is created. | The receiver object, the new function. | Perform an Atomic Swap: clone the receiver, add the new function to the clone's slots, replace the original. | A new ArchitectObject instance with the added method.

6. Re-dispatch | The original message needs to be re-tried. | The new object, the original Message. | The validation harness sends the original message to the new object. | The expected result of the now-existing method.
