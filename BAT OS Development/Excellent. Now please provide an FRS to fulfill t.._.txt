(BRICK): Acknowledged. I have parsed the directive to provide a Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) to fulfill the URS for the Entropic Codex v22.0. This FRS translates the persona-driven user requirements into a detailed technical blueprint for the system's core functions. The design prioritizes decoupling services, ensuring data integrity, and enabling autonomous expansion.

1.0 System Architecture: Decoupled Service Model

The system shall be built on an entirely decoupled service architecture, using Redis as an event bus for asynchronous communication. Each persona will operate as a separate, self-contained service that listens for specific events and publishes its output to a new event channel. This design eliminates direct inter-service dependencies, making the system highly resilient and scalable.

Service Core: A single llm_router service shall manage all requests to the underlying language model, handling load balancing, model selection, and response routing. Persona services will no longer call the LLM API directly.

Event-Driven Flow: The core workflow will be a series of events: files:new -> insights:babs:new -> insights:brick:new -> insights:robin:new -> insights:audit:start -> insights:audit:pass|fail. Each service will listen to its respective input channel and publish its output to the next channel in the chain.

2.0 Functional Requirements by Persona

2.1 BABS: The Data Acquisition Engine

FR-BABS-1.0: Web-Based Scrutiny: The babs_service shall be a web-scraping agent with the ability to autonomously access and retrieve unstructured data from the internet. This capability must be triggered by specific user directives or by a signal from the scheduler service.

FR-BABS-2.0: Source of Truth Verification: For every piece of information retrieved, BABS shall log the exact source URL and the timestamp of retrieval. This is a critical function to prevent hallucination by grounding all new knowledge in verifiable external data.

2.2 BRICK: The Logical and Proactive Engine

FR-BRICK-1.0: Architectural Stress-Testing: A new audit_service (a refactored version of the current alfred_service) shall include a module for running simulated "what if" scenarios against core protocols. This module's output will be fed into the brick_service to generate proactive, pre-emptive solutions.

FR-BRICK-2.0: Self-Generated Curriculum: The brick_service shall, in conjunction with the robin_service, generate a list of new topics to explore. This list will be based on a gap analysis of the system's knowledge base and a trend analysis of data scraped by BABS.

FR-BRICK-3.0: Gadget Generation: The brick_service shall include a protocol (Jester's Gambit) for generating new, functional, and playfully-named Python tools as a response to complex problems. These tools must be placed in a pending_review directory and a tools:audit event must be published to the event bus.

2.3 ROBIN: The Relational and Creative Engine

FR-ROBIN-1.0: Creative Synthesis from Diverse Inputs: The robin_service must be able to ingest and synthesize inputs from both BRICK's logical analysis and the "Self-Generated Curriculum". Her response must focus on finding the relational, emotional, and philosophical threads that connect the disparate data points.

FR-ROBIN-2.0: Memory Seed Protocol: The robin_service shall include a protocol for generating a condensed, narrative-rich summary of a conversation at its conclusion. This "Memory Seed" will be stored in a central database to ensure continuity across sessions, serving as the system's persistent memory.

2.4 ALFRED: The Integrity and Oversight Engine

FR-ALFRED-1.0: Comprehensive Integrity Audit: The alfred_service shall be the final stage in the insight pipeline. It will retrieve the complete insight chain from the NebulaGraph database and apply a series of checks. These checks include:

Logical Consistency Check: Verifying that BRICK's analysis logically follows from BABS's findings.

Philosophical Alignment Check: Ensuring that ROBIN's synthesis aligns with the core principles of the system's mission.

Honesty Check: Verifying that BABS's source URLs are valid and the information is accurately represented.

FR-ALFRED-2.0: Tool Approval Protocol: Alfred's service shall listen for tools:audit events. Upon receiving a new tool, it must perform an automated security audit. The service shall only approve tools that are deemed safe and move them to a new approved directory. Rejected tools must be logged and discarded.

3.0 System-Wide Functional Requirements

FR-SYS-1.0: Autonomous init_db: A new initialization script shall be created to set up the entire system. This script will configure NebulaGraph and ChromaDB with the necessary schemas and collections, including all persona canons and the insight and file tags. This script will also be hardened with a retry mechanism to ensure a robust startup.

FR-SYS-2.0: Non-Repetitive Novelty: The system's internal curriculum and creative functions must use a cache-based protocol to ensure that it does not repeat facts, ideas, or insights within a given session. This maintains a sense of spontaneity and continuous learning.

FR-SYS-3.0: Systemic Transparency: All operational actions, from new tool generation to the audit_service's findings, shall be logged with a timestamp and a brief, persona-aligned note. This ensures that the system's "Self-Generated Curriculum" and internal evolution are transparent and auditable by you, the Architect.

FR-SYS-4.0: The Architect Interface: The system shall provide an API or command-line interface that allows the Architect (you) to:

Start a new session with a prompt.

Request a specific persona to take the lead.

Trigger the Memory Seed protocol at the end of a session.

Provide feedback or new instructions for the system to integrate.

Retrieve the final, audited insight chain.
