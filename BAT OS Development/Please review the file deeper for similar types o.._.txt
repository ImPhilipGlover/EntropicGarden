You are right to look deeper. The same error that occurred when saving the main model also exists in another part of the code. Additionally, you've identified a key architectural weakness: the system isn't robust against crashes.

Here is a deeper analysis that finds the hidden bug and a concrete fix to make the system crash-safe.

1. The Hidden Bug in _incarnate_lora_experts

The exact same AttributeError from the previous issue is also present in the _incarnate_lora_experts method. It would have caused a crash the first time you tried to add a LoRA adapter from the staging directory.

The code incorrectly tries to access ._blob on the temporary file handle instead of assigning the Blob object itself.

Line to Replace:

The entire block for creating the lora_proxy object is flawed.

Python

with ZODB.blob.Blob().open('w') as blob_file:
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        shutil.copyfileobj(f, blob_file)
    lora_proxy = UvmObject(
        adapter_name=adapter_name,
        model_blob=blob_file._blob
    )
    pLLM_obj.lora_repository[adapter_name] = lora_proxy


Replacement Block:

Python

# Create an empty Blob object first.
lora_blob = ZODB.blob.Blob()
# Open the blob to get a file-like object and write the data.
with lora_blob.open('w') as blob_file:
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        shutil.copyfileobj(f, blob_file)
# Assign the Blob object itself to the proxy object's slot.
lora_proxy = UvmObject(
    adapter_name=adapter_name,
    model_blob=lora_blob
)
pLLM_obj.lora_repository[adapter_name] = lora_proxy


2. Making the System Crash-Safe

Your second point is critical. When the script crashes, it leaves the ZODB .lock file behind, preventing a clean restart. To fix this, the main execution block at the end of the file must be wrapped in a try...finally statement. This guarantees that the database connection is closed no matter how the program exits, which automatically releases the lock.

Line to Replace:

The entire if __name__ == '__main__': block at the end of the script is not robust.

Python

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvm = BatOS_UVM(DB_FILE, BLOB_DIR)
    try:
        asyncio.run(uvm.run())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("[UVM] Main loop interrupted by user.")


Replacement Block:

Python

if __name__ == '__main__':
    uvm = BatOS_UVM(DB_FILE, BLOB_DIR)
    try:
        asyncio.run(uvm.run())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # This is now handled by the signal handler within uvm.run()
        # but we keep it here as a final failsafe.
        print("\n[UVM] Manual shutdown initiated by Architect.")
    except Exception as e:
        # This will catch crashes like the pickling error and log them.
        print(f"\n[UVM] FATAL UNHANDLED EXCEPTION: {e}")
        traceback.print_exc()
    finally:
        # This block ensures that even on a hard crash, we attempt
        # to close the database connection to release the .lock file.
        print("[UVM] Finalizing shutdown...")
        if uvm and uvm.db and not uvm.db.is_closed():
            uvm.db.close()
            print("[UVM] Database connection closed.")
