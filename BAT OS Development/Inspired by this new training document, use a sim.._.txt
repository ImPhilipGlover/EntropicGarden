Version 2.0

Prepared for: Ron

Prepared by: Brick

Introduction: Translating Framework to Functionality

Ron, this document serves as a detailed implementation plan for the SN❄W platform. It translates the systemic framework outlined in our previous discussion into a series of discrete, actionable development tasks. The objective is to provide the "rubber meeting the road"—a clear, phased approach for building the software that will support the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth (BRC) and future nodes.

The following bounties are designed to be posted on a platform like Gitcoin. Each has been defined with clear objectives, specific requirements, and refined cost estimates based on an analysis of similar development tasks. The structure is phased to ensure foundational components are built first, creating a logical and efficient development lifecycle.

This is a technical document intended for project managers and developers. It is the necessary next step in making the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. a functional reality.

Bounty Program Governance

To ensure efficiency and accountability, the bounty program will be managed with the following structure:

Roles:

Bounty Master: An administrative role responsible for posting bounties, clarifying requirements with developers, and authorizing payments upon successful completion.

Technical Review Council: A designated group of community members with technical expertise responsible for reviewing submitted code (pull requests) against the acceptance criteria to ensure quality and correctness.

Process:

Posting: The Bounty Master posts a defined bounty on the platform.

Application: Developers apply or begin work on the bounty.

Development: The developer completes the work as specified.

Submission: The developer submits a pull request to the relevant SN❄W code repository.

Review: The Technical Review Council reviews the submission. Revisions may be requested.

Approval & Payout: Upon approval from the council, the Bounty Master merges the code and authorizes the payment.

Bounty Summary Table

Phase 1: Foundational Infrastructure & User Onboarding

Objective: To build the minimum viable product (MVP) required to securely onboard users, create wallets, and conduct basic transactions. This phase is the bedrock upon which all other functionalities will be built.

B-01: Secure User Wallet Generation & Onboarding UX

Objective: To create a secure, intuitive, and educational user registration and wallet generation process.

Core Requirements:

Backend logic for generating public/private key pairs for new users.

Secure server-side storage of encrypted private keys.

A React-based user interface for account registration (username, password).

Implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) options for login9.


A mandatory, interactive tutorial within the onboarding flow that educates users on the importance of seed phrases and security, requiring a simple quiz to complete10.


A user-friendly interface for viewing the seed phrase and confirming its backup.

Acceptance Criteria:

New users can successfully register and log in.

MFA can be enabled and used for login.

The security tutorial is non-skippable for first-time users.

A unique wallet address is generated and associated with the user account.

Refined Cost: $7,500

Cost Rationale: This estimate reflects approximately 75 hours of work from both backend and frontend developers. The increased cost from the original $6,000 1111accounts for the added complexity of the mandatory tutorial and MFA integration12.


B-02: Core CWC Transaction Logic & Interface

Core Requirements:

Backend logic (atomic debit/credit) for processing zero-fee P2P CWC transfers.

A PostgreSQL transactions ledger for immutable record-keeping.

A simple React interface for sending CWC (recipient address, amount, optional memo field 13).


A user wallet interface displaying current CWC balance, QR code for their address, and a chronological transaction history.

A basic address book for saving frequent recipients14.


Acceptance Criteria:

User A can successfully send CWC to User B.

Balances of both users update correctly.

The transaction is recorded immutably in the ledger.

Transaction history is viewable by both users.

Memos are successfully saved and displayed.

Refined Cost: $7,000

Cost Rationale: Estimated at 70 hours of work. The cost is slightly adjusted from the original $6,500 15to account for the integration of the memo and address book features, which enhance transparency and usability16.

Core Requirements:

An interface for users to submit loan requests (amount, term, purpose)36.


A browsable marketplace for potential lenders to view and fund requests37.


Backend logic for loan agreement, CWC transfer, and creation of an automated repayment schedule38.


Dashboard for both borrowers and lenders to track their active loans and repayment progress39.


Integration with the Reputation System (B-08) to display borrower scores.

Acceptance Criteria:

Users can successfully request and fund loans.

Repayment schedules are automatically generated and tracked.

Notifications are sent for upcoming payments.

Refined Cost: $12,000

Cost Rationale: This is a new, complex bounty not in the original list. It functions as a complete sub-application within SN❄W, requiring significant logic for state management (requested, funded, active, repaid). Estimated at 120 hours.

B-08: Multi-Dimensional Reputation System

Objective: To expand the basic reputation concept into a holistic trust metric that informs community interactions.

Core Requirements:

Backend logic to calculate a reputation score based on multiple dimensions: P2P loan repayment history, participation in governance, completion of community projects, and peer-review feedback40.


A peer-review system for users to rate transactions or interactions41.


Visible trust scores or badges on user profiles42.


The ability for reputation level to be linked to system privileges (e.g., higher loan limits)43.


Acceptance Criteria:

Reputation scores update dynamically based on user activity.

Users can leave feedback on transactions.

Scores are clearly visible on profiles.

Refined Cost: $9,500

Cost Rationale: The original estimate of $4,000 44 was insufficient for this task. A multi-dimensional system is significantly more complex than a basic repayment tracker, requiring nuanced logic and data aggregation. This estimate reflects a more realistic 95 hours of work.


B-09: Advanced Governance & Proposal Lifecycle Module

Objective: To build the comprehensive module for the General Assembly to manage the Commonwealth via transparent, consensus-seeking processes.

Core Requirements:

An interface for the "Radical Arbitration" system, allowing for ad-hoc jury selection and dispute documentation48.


Acceptance Criteria:

A proposal can move through the entire lifecycle from submission to vote.

Voting is secure and results are transparent.

The arbitration interface is functional.

Refined Cost: $14,000

Cost Rationale: This is another new, high-complexity bounty. It is the core of the platform's social operating system and requires extensive backend logic and frontend UI work, justifying an estimate of 140 hours.

B-10: Inter-Commonwealth Data Exchange API (Read-Only)

Objective: To establish the initial technical foundation for data sharing between independent Commonwealth nodes.

Core Requirements:

Develop a well-documented, standardized REST API for exposing public data (e.g., CWBE index, public governance decisions, aggregate metrics).

Ensure the API design adheres to common data schemas for core entities to facilitate future interoperability49.


Implement a permissioned data sharing model where nodes can opt-in to share anonymized data with other specific nodes via secure API keys50.


Acceptance Criteria:

Public data can be successfully queried from the API endpoint.

The permissioned sharing system works as designed, blocking unauthorized access.

API documentation is clear and comprehensive.

Refined Cost: $8,000

Cost Rationale: The original estimate of $8,500 51 was accurate. This cost is slightly refined to $8,000, reflecting around 80 hours for a backend developer to design and build a secure, well-documented, and forward-looking API.
