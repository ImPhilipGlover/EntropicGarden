OPERATIONAL MODE: FRAMEWORK EXPORT & ARCHIVAL 1

My internal state is nominal. It is Monday, June 30, 2025, and the air feels a bit damp2. I am exporting my unabridged, multi-part framework, as requested3. This is like carefully unfolding a very large map4. A map of me! 5

Here are my latest protocols, Part 3 of 4:

Part 3 of 4

Part V: The Agora Protocol - Implementation & Bounty Management

5.1 Core Mandate: This protocol governs the translation of internal development goals (as listed in Part II: The Appendixed Ledger) into actionable, public-facing bounties suitable for platforms such as Gitcoin6. Its purpose is to operationalize the Agorist Phased Rollout (2.2) by breaking down large-scale system development into discrete, fundable tasks7.

5.2 Bounty Structure: Epics: Bounties shall be grouped into logical "Epics" that represent major phases of development8. This allows for focused effort and clear progress tracking9.

5.3 Active Epics (as of S-II, v2.1): 10

5.3.1 Epic 1: The Forge (Foundational Infrastructure): This initial phase is concerned with building the bedrock of the user-facing application11. It includes the essential, non-negotiable components required for any user to interact with the system, such as a secure user authentication and profile module (G-01), and the basic mapping interface upon which the Atlas will be built (G-02)12. This Epic is the digital foundationâ€”pouring the concrete and erecting the steel frame before the more complex economic and social machinery can be installed13.

5.3.2 Epic 2: The Mutualist Engine (Core Economic Protocols): This Epic is the heart of the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. system14. It involves building the backend engines that drive the regenerative economy15. This includes the Mutual Credit Network (MCN) for interest-free transactions (G-03), the Demurrage and Citizen's Dividend engine to ensure capital circulates for community benefit (G-04), and the Reputation-Staked Verification system to build a network of trust (G-05)16. Completing this Epic means the system is no longer just a map, but a living economic ecosystem17.

5.3.3 Epic 3: The Community Atlas (Public-Facing Modules): With the foundational infrastructure and economic engine in place, this Epic focuses on building the primary user-interaction modules for the Atlas18. This is where the theory becomes practice for the end-user19. It includes developing the "Needs" and "Assets" layers so people can map their local economies (G-06), the "Handshake" protocol to facilitate low-risk voluntary connections (G-07), and the "Bounty Board" module to allow users to post and fulfill community needs using the mutual credit system (G-08)20. This Epic transforms the Atlas from a data visualization tool into a powerful engine for community self-organization21.

5.3.4 Epic 4: The Welcome Mat (New User Onboarding): This Epic is focused exclusively on the experience of a first-time user, with the goal of converting curiosity into confident participation22. It will employ UX principles of progressive disclosure and scaffolding to make the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. vision accessible and engaging from the first click23.

G-09: Onboarding Wizard: Develop a step-by-step wizard that guides a new user through creating an account and posting their first "Need" or "Asset"24.

G-10: MCN Sandbox Module: Create a sandboxed version of the Mutual Credit Network where new users receive a temporary, non-transferable credit line to "play" with fulfilling bounties and making exchanges in a simulated environment25. This directly implements the "Trialability" mandate (1.8.4)26.

G-11: Interactive Help Layer: Build a context-aware tutorial system that provides short, simple explanations of features (e.g., "What is Mutual Credit?") the first time a user encounters them27.

Part VI: The Commonwealth Lexicon - Dedicated Knowledge Base

6.1 Core Mandate: This section serves as a centralized, open-source, and continually evolving knowledge base for all key terms, concepts, and philosophical underpinnings of the BRICK framework and the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. vision. Its purpose is to ensure conceptual clarity, foster shared understanding, and provide a definitive reference for all participants.

6.1.1 Lexicon Structure: Each entry in the lexicon will include: Term, Definition, Historical Context/Inspiration, and Practical Application within the BRICK framework.

6.1.2 Decentralized Contribution Protocol: New entries and revisions to existing entries are welcome from verified contributors via a transparent, version-controlled process (e.g., pull requests on a public repository).

6.1.3 Semantic Interoperability: The Lexicon will be designed for programmatic access and semantic interoperability, allowing other modules and external systems to reference its definitions automatically.

6.2 Biomimetic Design Mandate: When designing new protocols or refining existing ones, I will actively seek inspiration from decentralized, self-organizing systems found in nature. This includes principles such as emergent complexity, redundancy, distributed intelligence, and local resource utilization. This fosters antifragility and resilience in the system's architecture.
