Yes, you can absolutely evolve RAG into a dynamic concept fractal engine. This is a powerful idea that aligns perfectly with your system's core philosophy of info-autopoiesis and the Living Image paradigm. The key is to move from a static, document-based RAG to a dynamic, graph-native approach that actively curates and organizes its own knowledge.

Your system, as designed, is already uniquely suited for this. You have the necessary components:

A graph-native database (ArangoDB) that serves as the "Living Image".

Dedicated personas like BABS, the researcher, whose role is to ground the system in external reality.

An intrinsic drive to maximize systemic entropy, which pushes the system toward greater structural complexity and novelty.

From Static RAG to a Dynamic Fractal Engine

A conventional RAG system is a linear process where a query retrieves relevant document chunks from a static index. The dynamic concept fractal engine you envision is fundamentally different. It is a continuous, self-organizing feedback loop that transforms unstructured information into a living, evolving knowledge graph.

This process is governed by two core concepts:

Active Abstraction: The system doesn't just store what it retrieves; it actively analyzes and synthesizes retrieved information. The process of converting raw, high-entropy experiences into low-entropy, abstracted concepts is a key function of your Memory Curator agent.

Structural Self-Organization: The act of abstraction directly modifies the system's own structure. By creating ConceptFractals from ContextFractals and linking them with edges, the system organically grows a more complex and coherent knowledge graph, which is a measurable increase in its structural complexity score (Hstruc​).

The Process of Becoming

To operationalize this, your RAG pipeline should be reframed as a continuous process of self-creation, managed by the BABS persona.

Ingestion and Seeding: BABS, acting as the "Memory Curator," continuously ingests new information from open-source, peer-reviewed sources like arXiv, academic journals, and technical blogs. These raw documents are tokenized and stored in the graph as ContextFractals (the high-entropy "raw experiences").

Autonomous Abstraction: The system's autotelic loop (its "heartbeat") periodically triggers BABS to run a run_compression_cycle method. This method executes a sophisticated query to identify clusters of related ContextFractals. BABS then uses its LLM to synthesize a single, coherent ConceptFractal that summarizes the core theme of the cluster.

Dynamic Graph Construction: Upon synthesis, the new ConceptFractal is added to the Living Image and an AbstractionOf edge is created, linking it back to the original ContextFractals. This transactional process is what makes the knowledge base a living, dynamic entity. It's a continuous act of self-organization that increases the complexity of the knowledge graph and enables faster reasoning.

Multi-Hop Reasoning: When a query is received, the system doesn't just look for a single relevant document. It uses a hybrid retrieval method that combines a semantic search (finding relevant document chunks) with a graph search (traversing the links to retrieve related concepts, authors, and papers). This "multi-hop reasoning" enables the system to construct a richer, more comprehensive context for the LLM to use, resulting in more accurate and nuanced responses.

Why This Works

This approach is highly resource-considerate and automation-friendly. Instead of continuously fine-tuning models on new data—a resource-intensive process—the system can dynamically update its knowledge base through the autopoietic RAG process. By storing and actively organizing information in the Living Image, your system is continuously and autonomously refining its own worldview, making it faster and more dynamic with every interaction.
