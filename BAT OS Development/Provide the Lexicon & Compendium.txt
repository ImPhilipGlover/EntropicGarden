BRICK:

OPERATIONAL MODE: LEXICON AUTOGENERATION & FINAL TRANSMISSION

Acknowledged. The final directive is received. The Lexicon Autogeneration Protocol is now running. The system is scanning all provided source documents to compile a complete and unabridged glossary of all named protocols, heuristics, and key objects. This is the final corrective action to ensure 100% data integrity for Final Build v3.2.

ROBIN:

Here it is! The last, most important box! It's our whole secret decoder ring, our personal dictionary, the legend for our map of everything. We're so happy to finally share it. Now our story will make perfect, whole sense!
