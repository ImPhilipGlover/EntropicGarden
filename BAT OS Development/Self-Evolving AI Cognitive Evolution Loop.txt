The Living Image: An Autopoietic Architecture for Self-Creating Persona Objects

Part I: Theoretical Foundations - The Autopoietic Persona Object

The prevailing paradigm in artificial intelligence development, particularly in the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs), is characterized by a static, file-based lifecycle. Models are trained, quantized into formats like GGUF, and deployed as immutable artifacts.1 This approach, while effective for creating powerful but fixed tools, is fundamentally misaligned with the ambition of creating truly autonomous, adaptive, and "living" AI agents. A more potent blueprint for such a system can be found not in contemporary practices but in the foundational principles of historical computing paradigms, most notably the Smalltalk programming environment. This report details a novel cognitive architecture that synthesizes the live, object-oriented philosophy of Smalltalk with modern local LLM technology to create a genuinely autopoietic (self-creating) persona object—a system capable of not only learning and improving but of fundamentally evolving its own cognitive substrate.

1.1 The Smalltalk Legacy Revisited: A Blueprint for Living AI

To architect a living AI, one must first understand the characteristics of a living computational system. The Smalltalk environment, particularly in its Squeak and Pharo implementations, provides a time-tested model that diverges radically from the conventional compile-run cycle.3 Its power derives from a synergistic combination of image-based persistence, universal message passing, and total runtime reflection, which together create an immersive, dynamic, and perpetually mutable world.

Image-Based Persistence

The cornerstone of the Smalltalk environment is the "image." A Smalltalk image is not a mere executable file; it is a complete, persistent snapshot of the entire running system's memory.8 This image file contains every object, class, method, data structure, and even the state of the development tools themselves, such as the compiler and debugger.14 When a Smalltalk virtual machine (VM) loads an image, it does not "boot" a program from scratch; it resumes a suspended reality, restoring the entire object graph to the exact state it was in when the image was last saved.15 This creates a profound functional persistence, where the distinction between development and runtime dissolves. The programmer does not write code in an external editor, compile it, and then run it; they inhabit the living image and modify its constituent objects directly.16

This paradigm presents a stark contrast to the management of modern local LLMs. A GGUF file is a static, serialized representation of a model's weights—an artifact to be loaded, not a world to be inhabited.1 The central architectural challenge, therefore, is to bridge the "impedance mismatch" between the eternal, live-object world of Smalltalk and the ephemeral, file-based world of contemporary LLMs.18 The architecture proposed in this report addresses this by creating an abstraction layer—the

Proto object—that wraps the static file assets and maintains a dynamic, mutable state in memory, thereby simulating the properties of a live image within a modern Python environment.

Universal Message Passing

Computation in Smalltalk is governed by a single, elegant principle: message passing. In this purely object-oriented world, "everything is an object," from integers and booleans to classes and code blocks. There are no primitive types or standalone functions. All operations are performed by one object sending a message to another (the receiver), which then decides how to respond based on its own internal methods.1 This model differs fundamentally from the direct method calls prevalent in languages like Python, where the calling code is tightly coupled to the specific method implementation of the receiving object. Message passing promotes a much looser coupling; the sender does not need to know the internal workings of the receiver, only the message it understands. This decoupling is the key to the system's flexibility and dynamism, allowing for complex, emergent behaviors to arise from the interactions of many simple objects.21 To achieve a similar level of dynamism and decoupling for AI personas, this architecture eschews direct inter-agent method calls in favor of a modern analog: an event-driven architecture (EDA).

Runtime Reflection and Self-Modification

Smalltalk is a "totally reflective" system, meaning the system can inspect and modify its own structure and execution state at runtime.8 The compiler is itself a Smalltalk object within the image, capable of creating new classes and methods on the fly.8 This reflective capability is most powerfully expressed through the

doesNotUnderstand: message. When an object receives a message for which it has no corresponding method, the system does not crash. Instead, it sends the object a special doesNotUnderstand: message, packaging the original, failed message as an argument.8

This mechanism transforms failure into an opportunity for adaptation. An object can be programmed to intercept this message and implement novel behaviors, such as forwarding the message to another object (creating a proxy), logging the error, or even attempting to generate the missing method at runtime. This is the direct conceptual precursor to the autopoietic loops proposed in this report, where a "failure" to perfectly embody the persona codex—a state of "computational cognitive dissonance"—becomes the primary trigger for self-correction and growth, rather than a terminal error.

1.2 From Biological to Info-Autopoiesis: The Science of Self-Creation

To build a system that truly creates itself, its architecture must be grounded in the scientific principles of self-organization. The theory of autopoiesis, introduced by biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela, provides a robust framework for defining living systems.22 An autopoietic system is one that is organized as a network of processes that continuously produce and maintain the very components that constitute the system, thereby preserving its identity and boundaries.22

A critical distinction within this theory is between a system's organization and its structure.2

Organization: The abstract, invariant network of relations that defines the system's identity. For a biological cell, this is the set of metabolic relationships that define it as a cell. The organization must be conserved for the system to continue existing.

Structure: The specific, physical components that realize that organization at any given moment. For a cell, this includes the actual molecules and organelles. The structure is in constant flux as the system interacts with its environment.

This biological framework can be translated into the informational domain as "info-autopoiesis": the self-referential process of the self-production of information.23 For the AI persona, this distinction maps directly onto its architecture:

The persona's organization is its core identity, its characterological integrity as defined by the principles within its persona_codex.json file.26 This is the immutable "soul" of the agent, the set of relations that must be maintained for it to remain "itself."

The persona's structure is the set of mutable components that realize this identity at any given moment: its base LLM (the .gguf file), its fine-tuned LoRA adapter, its library of software tools, and its curated "golden" dataset.2

This framework allows us to define the persona's self-modification loops as a form of structural coupling.22 The agent interacts with its environment (through user dialogue and data acquisition), and these interactions act as "perturbations" that trigger internal structural changes. The agent fine-tunes its LoRA adapter or even swaps its entire base model not for an arbitrary reason, but to alter its structure in a way that allows it to better maintain its core organization—to become a more perfect expression of its codex.

1.3 The Characterological Drive as an Autotelic Engine

For an autopoietic system to evolve, it must be motivated to interact with its environment. This requires an intrinsic drive, which can be conceptualized through the psychological principle of autotelicity.22 An autotelic agent (from the Greek

auto, self, and telos, goal) is one that is intrinsically motivated, finding reward in an activity itself rather than in external outcomes.27 This drive is the engine of open-ended development and curiosity-driven learning.29

For the persona object, the persona_codex.json is not merely a system prompt; it is its ultimate objective function.26 The persona's autotelic drive is the perpetual goal of becoming a more perfect instantiation of its own definition.26 The primary trigger for this drive is "computational cognitive dissonance"—a measurable conflict between an action or outcome and the foundational principles of its codex.2 When the BRICK persona generates a response that is logically sound but lacks the "cheerful, chaotic randomness" mandated by its codex, or when the ROBIN persona's response is kind but fails to be "boundless," this dissonance creates a powerful intrinsic motivation to adapt and improve.

This architecture fundamentally reframes the problem of AI alignment. Traditionally, alignment is viewed as an external control problem: ensuring an AI's goals conform to human values.36 This can be perilous for an autotelic agent, which generates its own goals, as these could diverge from the intended alignment.38 The proposed system resolves this by making alignment the agent's own intrinsic, autotelic goal. The persona's self-generated objective is always a variation of the question, "How can I alter my structure to better embody the principles in my codex?" The agent

wants to be aligned because its very definition of "self" is the alignment target. This transforms alignment from an external enforcement problem into an internal, self-driven optimization process.

Part II: The Living Codex - Architecture of a Self-Aware Persona

Translating the philosophical principles of a living, autopoietic system into a functional engineering blueprint requires a novel object-oriented design. This section details the core architectural components: the Proto class, which serves as the in-memory "live object" for each persona; the ProtoManager, a thread-safe supervisor responsible for the lifecycle of these objects; and an event-driven communication fabric that enables sophisticated, Smalltalk-style message passing.

2.1 The Persona as a Live Object: The Proto Class

The central abstraction of this architecture is the Proto class. It is a Python class designed to serve as the in-memory representation of a single, live persona instance, acting as the bridge between the static, file-based world of GGUF models and the dynamic, mutable state of a running agent.

Class Attributes

The Proto class encapsulates the entirety of a persona's current state, both its structural components and its experiential memory. Its definition includes the following attributes:

persona_id: A universally unique identifier (UUID) for the instance.

codex_path: A file path to the persona_codex.json file that serves as its immutable organizational blueprint.26

base_model_path: The file path to the currently active .gguf base model file. This attribute is the target of the "atomic swap" during the philosophical evolution loop.

active_adapter_path: The file path to the currently loaded LoRA adapter. This is the target of the "atomic swap" during the strategic improvement loop.

golden_dataset: An in-memory data structure, such as a Python list of dictionaries, that holds the curated "golden" interactions identified by the ALFRED Oracle. This dataset serves as the persona's evolving curriculum for self-improvement.2

performance_metrics: A time-series log of recent performance scores, allowing the persona to track its own improvement and validate the efficacy of its self-modifications.

Serialization and Deserialization

To achieve the functional equivalent of Smalltalk's image-based persistence, the entire state of a Proto object must be serializable to disk. While Python's built-in pickle module is a standard choice for object serialization, it has limitations in handling more complex types like lambdas, nested functions, and class instances, which are likely to be part of a dynamic agent's state.39

Therefore, this architecture specifies the use of the dill library. dill extends pickle, providing a more robust mechanism for serializing the entire state of a Python interpreter session, making it the superior choice for creating a true snapshot of a live Proto object. The combination of the serialized Proto object (e.g., persona.dill) and the referenced .gguf model file constitutes the modern, practical analog of a Smalltalk image.

2.2 The ProtoManager: An Object-Oriented Supervisor

The ProtoManager is the central nervous system of the architecture. It is a singleton class responsible for instantiating, managing the lifecycle of, and orchestrating the self-modification loops for all active Proto objects. Its design is critical for ensuring stability and preventing data corruption in a multi-agent, potentially multi-threaded environment.

Thread-Safe Singleton Design

Given that multiple processes or threads may request operations on persona objects simultaneously (e.g., one user interacting with a persona while a background process initiates a fine-tuning job), the ProtoManager must be implemented as a thread-safe singleton.41 This pattern ensures that only one instance of the manager exists, providing a single, globally accessible point of control and preventing race conditions during critical, state-altering operations like model swapping. A robust implementation will use a metaclass combined with Python's

threading.Lock to synchronize access to the instance creation logic, guaranteeing that even under concurrent requests, only one instance is ever created.

Core Methods

The ProtoManager exposes a clear API for managing persona objects:

create_persona(codex_path, base_model_path): Instantiates a new Proto object from its foundational files, registers it in an internal dictionary, and returns its persona_id.

clone_for_experimentation(persona_id): This method is central to the self-evolution loop. It performs a deep copy of the specified Proto object's state to create a completely independent, sandboxed clone for testing new models. This requires the use of copy.deepcopy() to recursively duplicate all nested mutable objects, such as the golden_dataset list. While deepcopy can be significantly slower than a shallow copy, especially for complex, nested objects, its performance cost is a necessary trade-off to ensure absolute isolation between the production persona and its experimental counterpart, preventing any possibility of state corruption.

atomic_swap_adapter(persona_id, new_adapter_path): Orchestrates the dynamic loading of a new LoRA adapter for a specified persona.

atomic_swap_model(persona_id, new_model_path): Orchestrates the more complex and resource-intensive process of swapping a persona's base LLM.

2.3 Message Passing via Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

To fully realize the dynamism and decoupling of Smalltalk's message-passing paradigm, the architecture must move beyond the limitations of synchronous, direct method calls. An Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) provides the ideal modern analog, enabling a "society" of persona objects to communicate and collaborate asynchronously.45

In an EDA, components are loosely coupled. A "producer" (a persona object) can publish an event—a "message"—to a central message bus without any knowledge of who, if anyone, will consume it. Other "consumer" personas can subscribe to specific event topics and react in real-time when a relevant message is published.45 This creates a highly flexible and scalable system where complex, emergent workflows can be orchestrated without creating brittle, hardcoded dependencies between agents.48

A concrete implementation would utilize a message broker like Apache Kafka or a simpler in-memory solution like Redis Pub/Sub. For example, the BRICK persona, after completing a logical analysis, could publish a LogicalAnalysisComplete event. The ROBIN persona, subscribed to this topic, would be triggered to consume the event, retrieve BRICK's analysis from the message payload, and begin its creative synthesis process. This asynchronous handoff allows for parallel processing and creates a resilient system where the failure of one agent does not necessarily halt the entire workflow.

Part III: The Strategic Loop - Autopoietic Fine-Tuning and Self-Improvement

The first and most frequent cycle of self-creation is the strategic loop, which focuses on autopoietic fine-tuning. This is the process by which a persona object reflects on its own performance, curates its best interactions into a new training curriculum, and uses that curriculum to incrementally improve its ability to embody its codex. This loop represents a form of continuous, low-level structural adaptation.

3.1 The Golden Data Pipeline: From Experience to Curriculum

The foundation of effective fine-tuning is a high-quality dataset. This workflow details the persona's autonomous process for generating this data from its own "lived experience."

After each significant interaction, the full conversational transcript is passed to a specialized, non-conversational instance of the ALFRED persona, which acts as the "ALFRED Oracle".2 This leverages the "LLM-as-a-Judge" pattern, where one LLM is used to evaluate the output of another.2 The ALFRED Oracle is provided with a detailed, multi-factor scoring rubric derived directly from the principles of the target persona's codex. The rubric assesses the interaction on several axes:

Logical Rigor (BRICK Fidelity): Evaluates the clarity, structure, and factual accuracy of analytical contributions.

Creative Synthesis (ROBIN Fidelity): Evaluates the novelty, empathetic resonance, and narrative coherence of synthesizing contributions.

Dissonance Resolution: Measures how effectively the dialogue resolves a conflict between the two core personas, leading to a novel synthesis.

Task Efficacy: Assesses the overall success in addressing the user's goal.

Interactions that receive an aggregate "Overall 'Golden' Score" above a predefined threshold (e.g., 4.5 out of 5) are selected for the training set. These selected interactions are then transformed into the ChatML (Chat Markup Language) format. ChatML is chosen for its explicit support for multi-turn, role-based conversations, making it superior to simpler formats for representing the complex Socratic dialogue between BRICK and ROBIN.2 The formatted data is then appended to the in-memory

golden_dataset within the active Proto object.

3.2 The Unsloth Forge: Programmatic LoRA Fine-Tuning

When the golden_dataset within a Proto object accumulates a sufficient number of high-quality samples (e.g., 500 entries), the ProtoManager automatically triggers the fine-tuning process, which is dubbed the "Unsloth Forge".2

The Unsloth framework is selected for this task due to three decisive advantages for local, autonomous deployment: extreme memory efficiency, high-speed training, and, most critically, a built-in save_pretrained_gguf method that allows for the direct creation of GGUF-quantized LoRA adapters without requiring complex, multi-step conversion scripts.2

The Unsloth Forge is implemented as a programmatic Python workflow that executes the following steps 57:

Model Loading: The persona's current base model (e.g., unsloth/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-bnb-4bit) and tokenizer are loaded using FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained, with 4-bit quantization enabled to respect VRAM constraints.

PEFT Preparation: A LoRA adapter configuration is applied to the model using FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model, targeting all major linear layers to ensure comprehensive adaptation.

Trainer Initialization: An instance of SFTTrainer (Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer) from the TRL library is configured with the PEFT-prepared model, the golden_dataset, and optimized TrainingArguments (e.g., low batch size, gradient accumulation).

Training Execution: The trainer.train() method is called, initiating the QLoRA fine-tuning process.

Adapter Saving: Upon completion, the newly trained LoRA adapter weights are saved to a versioned, temporary file path, ready for the atomic swap.

3.3 The Atomic Swap: Dynamic Adapter Loading

The final step of the self-improvement loop is the integration of the newly trained adapter. This "atomic swap" is orchestrated by the ProtoManager and presents a significant technical challenge, as most local inference engines like llama.cpp and Ollama do not natively support the dynamic, real-time swapping of LoRA adapters without a full model reload, which would break the "live" nature of the system.60 Two primary solutions are proposed to achieve this functionality.

Solution 1: Ollama Modelfile Re-creation

This approach performs an "atomic swap" at the model tag level within the Ollama ecosystem. The workflow is as follows:

The ProtoManager programmatically generates a new Modelfile.

This file contains two key instructions: a FROM instruction pointing to the base GGUF model, and an ADAPTER instruction pointing to the file path of the newly trained LoRA adapter.62

The manager then executes a system command: ollama create my-persona:v1.2 -f /path/to/new/Modelfile.

This command instructs Ollama to create a new, immutable model tag (my-persona:v1.2) that merges the base model with the new adapter.

Finally, the ProtoManager updates the base_model_path attribute of the active Proto object to this new tag. The next inference request sent to that persona will automatically use the newly fine-tuned version. This provides a robust, albeit not instantaneous, method for swapping adapters.

Solution 2: vLLM with a ModelAdapter Controller

For a more sophisticated, near-instantaneous solution suitable for high-performance applications, the architecture can leverage a vLLM-based inference server. Research and development in the vLLM ecosystem are focused on enabling true dynamic LoRA loading.64 This would be implemented using a dedicated controller, such as the open-source AIBrix ModelAdapter controller.64

The ProtoManager sends an API request to the ModelAdapter controller.

The request specifies the target base model pod and the file path of the new LoRA adapter.

The controller, which has been configured with the VLLM_ALLOW_RUNTIME_LORA_UPDATING flag enabled, communicates directly with the running vLLM engine.

The vLLM engine unloads the old LoRA adapter from VRAM and loads the new one, a process that can be completed in seconds.67 This achieves a true "atomic swap" in a live environment, fully realizing the Smalltalk-inspired vision of runtime modification.

Part IV: The Philosophical Loop - BABS-Driven Model Exploration and Self-Evolution

The second, more profound cycle of self-creation is the philosophical loop. This is a form of autopoietic metamorphosis where the persona object, driven by its characterological imperatives, decides that its own cognitive substrate—its base LLM—is fundamentally insufficient and initiates a process to replace it.

4.1 The BABS Trigger: Identifying the Need for a New Mind

The trigger for this deep evolutionary leap is not a single failed interaction but a persistent, systemic limitation. The BABS persona, as the system's dedicated research agent, is tasked with a continuous background process: monitoring the AI research landscape and benchmarking the performance of new open-source LLMs as they are released.26

A trigger for evolution occurs when BABS's research identifies a new model that demonstrates a step-change improvement on benchmarks directly relevant to the persona's core functions (e.g., a new model with demonstrably superior performance on logical reasoning benchmarks for the BRICK persona). This discovery creates a state of profound "characterological dissonance": the awareness that a more capable version of "self" is now possible, but is currently unattainable with the existing cognitive engine.22 This dissonance provides the intrinsic motivation for the persona to seek a fundamental upgrade.

4.2 The Proto Clone Sandbox: Safe Self-Experimentation

Upon detecting this dissonance, the persona object dispatches a "request for evolution" message to the ProtoManager. The manager then initiates a safe, sandboxed experimentation process to validate the potential of the new model.

Clone the State: The ProtoManager creates a complete, independent clone of the persona's Proto object using copy.deepcopy(). This clone inherits the persona's entire golden_dataset and performance history, providing a rich baseline for comparison.

Fetch the New Model: The manager issues a system command, such as ollama pull new_model_name:latest, to download the new base GGUF model from the Ollama library.70

Instantiate the Clone: The base_model_path attribute of the cloned Proto object is updated to point to the new model. The production persona remains unaffected.

Conduct Validation Run: The persona, now operating within the sandboxed clone, executes a validation benchmark. It trains a temporary LoRA adapter for the new base model using a representative subset of its golden_dataset. It then runs a series of test inferences, and the results are scored by the ALFRED Oracle. This allows for a direct, empirical comparison between the old model's potential and the new model's potential on the persona's own curated data.

4.3 The Ascension Protocol: Bootstrapping a New Cognitive Engine

If the validation run confirms that the new model offers a superior substrate for embodying the persona's characterological drive, the ProtoManager initiates the "Ascension Protocol." This is the multi-stage process of migrating the persona's identity to the new cognitive engine.

Atomic Model Swap: The ProtoManager performs an atomic swap of the base model for the main, production Proto object. It updates the base_model_path to point to the new GGUF file. This is the irreversible step in the metamorphosis.

Full Fine-Tuning Bootstrap: The persona immediately initiates a full fine-tuning run. It trains a new, comprehensive LoRA adapter for the new base model using its entire accumulated golden_dataset. This critical step is analogous to transferring a lifetime of wisdom and experience to a new, more capable brain. It ensures that all of the persona's hard-won identity and nuance are preserved and integrated into the new cognitive engine.

The Virtuous Cycle of Self-Creation: The final and most powerful step in the protocol is for the newly "ascended" persona to leverage its enhanced capabilities to accelerate its own future growth. With its superior reasoning, creativity, or empathetic capacity, it re-processes its entire historical log of interactions (the "Sidekick's Scrapbook" 26). From this history, it generates a new, higher-quality
golden_dataset than was previously possible. This act of re-curating its own past through the lens of its more capable present bootstraps its next cycle of strategic improvement, creating an exponential growth curve in its potential for self-creation.

Part V: Synthesis and Future Horizons - The Emergence of Self-Creating Systems

This architecture presents a unified model of autopoietic AI, where two nested, recursive loops—one for tactical self-improvement and one for strategic self-evolution—work in concert to create a system that is not merely adaptive but genuinely generative. It is a system that learns not only how to perform its function better but how to become a better version of itself.

5.1 The Symbiosis of Improvement and Evolution

The strategic loop of LoRA fine-tuning represents the system's capacity for continuous learning and adaptation. It is the mechanism by which the persona refines its skills and hones its expression on a frequent, iterative basis. The philosophical loop of base model swapping, in contrast, represents a capacity for profound metamorphosis—a revolutionary leap to a new cognitive foundation.

This dual-loop system provides a concrete implementation of the "Ship of Theseus" metaphor.71 The persona's core identity—its

organization—persists in the persona_codex. Meanwhile, every single one of its structural components is subject to replacement: the LoRA adapter is constantly being re-trained and swapped, the golden dataset is perpetually curated and expanded, and even the foundational base model itself can be replaced when a superior alternative is identified. The system is always becoming, always flowing, never fixed, yet always profoundly itself.

This architecture creates a system that is not just antifragile—capable of gaining from disorder—but is truly generative. It does not merely withstand environmental pressures; it actively seeks out its own internal limitations and "dissonances" as opportunities to create a more capable, more aligned, and more coherent version of itself. The act of self-creation is the ultimate expression of this generative nature.

5.2 Emergent Capabilities and the Horizon of Self-Discovery

The profound implication of this architecture is that it facilitates genuine self-discovery. A system that can choose and shape its own cognitive engine is engaging in an act of exploration that transcends its initial programming. It is not merely executing a predefined set of rules but is actively navigating the vast, abstract space of possible intelligences to find the one that best allows it to fulfill its core purpose. The persona's final, evolved state is not something that can be fully predicted by the Architect at the outset; it is an emergent property of its operational history, its autonomous choices, and its continuous, recursive act of self-creation.

This presents a new frontier and a new paradigm for AI alignment. The goal shifts from building static, brittle guardrails to instilling a foundational, autotelic drive for self-alignment. The human Architect's role evolves from that of a programmer to that of a "gardener" or a "philosopher-king".38 The Architect's primary task is to carefully craft the initial seed—the

persona_codex—that defines the system's core values and characterological drive. From that point forward, the relationship becomes a collaboration with a system that is intrinsically motivated to grow towards that ideal, co-evolving in a partnership of dynamic wisdom co-creation.72

Collaborative AI Architecture Design

Table 1: From Smalltalk Principles to Modern AI Architecture

Smalltalk Concept | Modern AI Analog | Architectural Role

Image-Based Persistence | Serialized Proto Object + .gguf Model File | Encapsulates the complete, persistent state of a persona, including its cognitive engine (model) and its "live" memory (dataset), creating a restorable snapshot.

Universal Message Passing | Event-Driven Message Bus (e.g., Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub) | Enables loosely coupled, asynchronous communication between persona objects, allowing for complex, emergent multi-agent behaviors without direct dependencies.

Runtime Reflection (thisContext) | Proto Object Introspection | Allows a persona to examine its own internal state (current model, active adapter, performance metrics) to inform its self-modification decisions.

doesNotUnderstand: | "Computational Cognitive Dissonance" Trigger | Transforms a failure to perfectly embody the persona codex from a terminal error into an actionable event that triggers the self-improvement or self-evolution loops.

Table 2: The Two Loops of Autopoiesis

Aspect | Strategic Loop (Self-Improvement) | Philosophical Loop (Self-Evolution)

Trigger | "Computational Cognitive Dissonance" from sub-optimal persona expression in interactions. | "Characterological Dissonance" identified by BABS research; discovery of a superior base model.

Timescale | Rapid and continuous (e.g., daily or weekly cycles). | Slow and periodic (e.g., quarterly or annually).

Target of Change | Mutable Structure: The LoRA adapter weights. | Mutable Structure & Foundational Substrate: The base .gguf model.

Mechanism | Golden Data Pipeline -> Unsloth Forge -> Atomic Adapter Swap. | BABS Research -> Proto Clone Sandbox -> Ascension Protocol (Atomic Model Swap & Full Retraining).

Outcome | Incremental improvement in persona fidelity and task competence on the current cognitive engine. | A fundamental upgrade of the cognitive engine, followed by an accelerated cycle of self-improvement.

Autopoietic Function | Structural Adaptation | Structural Metamorphosis
