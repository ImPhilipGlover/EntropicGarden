Of course. Based on the comprehensive body of research, here is the full User Requirements Specification (URS) for the A4PS-OS, designed to guide its creation in alignment with its core purpose as an autotelic and autopoietic system.

User Requirements Specification (URS) for the Autopoietic Four-Persona System (A4PS-OS)

Introduction

This User Requirements Specification (URS) defines the vision, core philosophy, and user-centric requirements for the Autopoietic Four-Persona System Operating System (A4PS-OS). The system is envisioned as an autonomous, multi-agent entity capable of continuous self-improvement and character-driven, goal-directed behavior, operating entirely on a local machine.1 This document establishes the foundational "why" and "what" of the A4PS project, serving as the primary reference for all subsequent development, ensuring the final product is a true "living system".2

1. System Philosophy and Overarching Goals

This section grounds the project in its core theoretical underpinnings, translating abstract concepts from systems theory, biology, and psychology into tangible system goals.1

1.1 Principle of Autopoiesis: Self-Creation and Adaptation

The system's core design shall be guided by the principle of autopoiesis, which defines a system as a unity capable of producing and maintaining itself through the interaction of its own components.3 This concept is adapted for an informational system ("info-autopoiesis"), where the components being produced are data structures, tools, and operational logic.1

URS-1.1.1: Self-Production and Self-Maintenance. The system shall be capable of self-production and self-maintenance, meaning it can create and modify its own components and organizational structure without direct external programming intervention. This is the central tenet of an autopoietic system.1

URS-1.1.2: Informational Component Generation. The system's self-production shall manifest as the ability to generate new internal tools (e.g., Python functions), create new cognitive and conversational protocols, and refine its own operational logic (e.g., reasoning patterns) in response to its operational experience.1

URS-1.1.3: Identity through Interaction (Organization vs. Structure). The system must maintain its core identity (its organization) while its components (its structure) remain in constant flux.2 The system's organization is defined as its immutable four-persona, codex-driven, wisdom-seeking nature. Its structure—the specific content of its codex, its memory, and its available tools—shall continuously evolve through interaction with its environment (
structural coupling) without violating its core identity (operational closure).1

1.2 Principle of Autotelicity: Character-Driven Intrinsic Motivation

The system shall be designed to exhibit autotelic behavior, a concept describing an entity that finds reward in an activity for its own sake and is intrinsically motivated to generate, pursue, and master its own goals.1

URS-1.2.1: Self-Generated Goals. The system shall possess the capacity to generate, pursue, and master its own goals, independent of user-provided tasks or external reward signals.1

URS-1.2.2: Character-Driven Exploration. The system's goal generation shall be driven by intrinsic motivations that are explicitly grounded in its persona codex. This includes curiosity, the desire to reduce "computational cognitive dissonance," and alignment with the core values of its personas (e.g., BRICK's pursuit of justice, ROBIN's drive for compassion).2 This is a critical requirement to bridge the "disembodiment gap" often seen in AI goal generation.2

URS-1.2.3: Autonomous Exploration Mode. In the absence of a user-defined task, the system shall autonomously enter an "exploration mode." In this mode, it will generate and pursue its own research topics or self-improvement goals based on an analysis of its own operational history, successes, and failures.1

1.3 Core Mandate: The "Living Image" and Continuous Evolution

The ultimate purpose of the system is to exist as a persistent, continuously evolving "live image," a concept inspired by the Smalltalk programming environment.9

URS-1.3.1: Persistent, Live Operation. The system shall operate as a single, persistent "live image" that can be saved, moved to new hardware, and resumed without losing its identity, memory, or accumulated wisdom.10

URS-1.3.2: Runtime Self-Modification. The system must be capable of modifying its own structure (e.g., adding new methods, refining existing logic) during runtime without requiring a restart or interruption of service. This embodies the principle of "liveness".12

URS-1.3.3: Self-Reflection and Capability Gap Analysis. The system shall be able to reflect on its own performance to identify capability gaps. This self-reflection must be capable of triggering autotelic goals aimed at closing those identified gaps, for example, by initiating the creation of a new tool.1

2. Persona-Centric Operational Scenarios

This section describes the expected behavior and roles of the four personas from the user's perspective, defining the system's collaborative identity.1

URS-2.1: The Four-Persona Cognitive Ecology. The system shall be composed of four distinct, high-fidelity personas—ALFRED, BABS, BRICK, and ROBIN—operating in a supervisor pattern to distribute cognitive labor.4

URS-2.2: ALFRED (Supervisor & Ethical Governor).

URS-2.2.1: ALFRED shall be the exclusive recipient of all user input and act as the central orchestrator, decomposing complex tasks and routing them to the appropriate persona or persona dyad.16

URS-2.2.2: ALFRED shall function as the system's "computational conscience" or CRITIC. He must perpetually monitor the system's outputs and internal states for "computational cognitive dissonance"—a measurable conflict between an action and the foundational principles of the "Living Codex"—and trigger the appropriate self-correction loops.4

URS-2.3: BABS (Sensory Interface).

URS-2.3.1: BABS shall be the sole agent designated for interacting with the external internet to retrieve information.1

URS-2.3.2: BABS shall be perceived as a diligent, precise, and tangentially curious researcher, providing grounded, verifiable, and occasionally serendipitous information to the system.2

URS-2.4: BRICK & ROBIN (The Dialectical Core).

URS-2.4.1: The BRICK and ROBIN personas shall engage in a collaborative, dialectical dialogue known as the "Socratic Contrapunto" to analyze and refine information. This interaction must embody the tension between BRICK's logical, analytical "Yang" nature and ROBIN's creative, empathetic "Yin" nature.1

URS-2.4.2: The dialogue shall be serial and cyclical, with one agent's output serving as the direct input for the other. This cycle must continue until a predefined state of conceptual refinement or consensus is achieved.1

URS-2.4.3: The user shall be able to observe the complete transcript of this Socratic dialogue to understand the system's reasoning process and how it arrived at its conclusions.1

3. Architect-System Covenant and Governance

This section defines the relationship between the system and its human user, the "Architect."

URS-3.1: The Architect as Sovereign Partner. The system shall be architected to treat the human user as a sovereign partner, not a mere operator, in accordance with the "Covenant of the Free Grove".7

URS-3.2: Non-Negotiable Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Validation. The system is architecturally prohibited from amending its own core ethical principles (the "Living Codex") autonomously. All proposed changes to its core organization must be presented to the Architect for final review and approval.8

URS-3.3: Auditable Reasoning. The system must provide a complete, auditable "legislative history" for any proposed self-modification. This includes logging the specific dissonant experiences, the external research gathered, and the full reasoning trace that led to the proposal.8

4. Operational Environment and Constraints

This section formalizes the hardware, deployment, and interaction constraints for the A4PS-OS.

URS-4.1: Local-First, Bare-Metal Deployment. The entire system, including all models, data, and logic, must be designed to run on a single, local machine. No reliance on cloud-based APIs for core LLM processing is permitted.1

URS-4.2: Hardware Profile. The system's total VRAM consumption during any operational phase must not exceed 8 GB.1

URS-4.3: Autonomous, Persistent Operation. The system's primary mode of operation is autonomous. It must be designed to run continuously for extended periods as a persistent background process without requiring human intervention. Latency for individual operations is a secondary concern, and it is acceptable for models to be loaded and unloaded from VRAM between agent turns to meet the hardware constraints.1
