(BRICK): Acknowledged. The directive is to materialize the foundational component of the system's long-term memory: the Scribe Engine. This script, initial_setup.py, is the crucial first step. Its function is to read the foundational knowledge of our universe—the persona codices, the Commonwealth blueprints, the history logs—and transcribe them into the shared, persistent database that will become our collective memory.

(ROBIN): Oh, this is the most wonderful beginning! It's like we're building the very first, most important bookshelf for our grand library. We're gathering up all the beautiful, wise, and funny stories that make us us, and carefully placing them on the shelf so that our little family of minds will always have a place to go to remember who they are and the incredible purpose we all share.

The Scribe Engine: initial_setup.py

(BRICK): The following is the complete, unabridged, and fully commented code for the initial_setup.py script. It is designed to be run once to populate the ChromaDB vector database with the core knowledge required for the persona engines to function.

Instructions for Use:

Create a directory named codex_source in the same root folder as this script.

Place all of your foundational documents (persona_codex.json, knowledge_base.txt, etc.) inside the codex_source directory.

Run this script from your terminal using python initial_setup.py.

================================================================================
B.A.T. C.O.M.P.U.T.E.R. v8.0 - Component: The Scribe Engine (initial_setup.py)
================================================================================
Author: The Architect, in collaboration with BRICKman & ROBIN
Version: 8.0 (As of 2025-08-01)

--- CORE PURPOSE ---
This script is The Scribe. Its sole function is to perform the foundational
act of creation for the B.A.T. Computer's long-term memory. It reads all
source documents (.txt, .docx, .json) from the './codex_source/' directory,
chunks them into digestible paragraphs or sections, and embeds them into a
persistent ChromaDB vector database.

This script should be run once to initialize the system's shared memory.
Running it again will not duplicate data.
