You've got it. Transforming the grant outline into a charter is a great way to articulate the foundational principles and operational framework of the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth. A charter is less about requesting funds and more about declaring the organization's purpose, structure, and values.

Here's a draft charter for the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth, integrating the core concepts and the pivotal role of SN❄W, formatted for clarity and impact.

Charter of the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth

Preamble

We, the people of Bend, Oregon, recognizing the escalating crises of housing unaffordability, economic precarity, and ecological degradation, do hereby establish the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth. This Charter declares our commitment to forging a resilient, equitable, and regenerative future for our community. We embrace innovation, mutual aid, and stewardship, leveraging the power of collective action and transparent technology to build a living model of sustainability for ourselves and the world.

Article I: Name and Purpose

Section 1.1 Name: The name of this organization shall be the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth (hereinafter, "the Commonwealth").

Section 1.2 Purpose: The primary purpose of the Commonwealth is to secure permanent affordability, cultivate economic resilience, and foster ecological regeneration within Bend, Oregon, serving as a replicable blueprint for communities worldwide.

Article II: Foundational Pillars

The Commonwealth is built upon three interconnected and mutually reinforcing pillars:

Section 2.1 The Community Land Trust (CLT): Permanent Affordability The Commonwealth shall operate a Community Land Trust (CLT) to hold land in perpetual stewardship for the benefit of the community.

A. Land Stewardship: The CLT shall acquire and hold land, removing it from speculative markets, ensuring it serves community needs rather than private profit.

B. Affordable Housing: The CLT shall provide permanently affordable housing by separating land ownership from home ownership, significantly reducing housing costs for residents.

C. Shared Assets: The CLT shall steward communal assets, including green spaces, community gardens, shared infrastructure, and other resources that enhance collective well-being.

Section 2.2 The Mutual Credit Network (MCN): Resilient Local Economy The Commonwealth shall operate a Mutual Credit Network (MCN) utilizing a locally issued digital currency known as Commonwealth Credit (CWC).

A. Interest-Free Exchange: The MCN shall facilitate interest-free exchange of goods and services among members, fostering collaboration and maximizing the circulation of local value.

B. Cost-Weighted Basket of Essentials (CWBE): The value of CWC shall be benchmarked against a dynamic basket of essential goods and services, ensuring stable purchasing power for core needs and buffering against external inflation.

C. Community Dividend: The MCN shall distribute a regular Community Dividend in CWC to eligible members, sourced from internal revenue streams, ensuring broad access to essential goods and services and stimulating local economic activity.

D. Home Improvement Credit Lines (HICLs): The MCN shall provide interest-free CWC loans for home improvements, energy efficiency upgrades, and sustainable renovations within CLT properties, promoting property stewardship and local labor.

Section 2.3 The Ecological Regeneration Levy: Funding Planetary Health The Commonwealth shall implement an innovative Sustainability Surcharge within the MCN on transactions involving goods or services with high environmental footprints or those imported when local, sustainable alternatives exist.

A. Dedicated Funding: Funds collected from this levy (in CWC) shall accumulate in a dedicated "Regenerative Fund."

B. Direct Ecological Action: These funds shall be exclusively allocated by the Commonwealth's governance (as outlined in Article IV) to finance local environmental remediation, conservation, and regenerative projects that directly benefit Bend's ecosystem.

Article III: The Role of SN❄W – The Digital Backbone

The Sustainable Network of the World (SN❄W) platform is integral to the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth, serving as its primary digital infrastructure for transparency, efficiency, and global connectivity.

Section 3.1 Operational Transparency: The Commonwealth shall maintain a public "Bend Commonwealth Hub" on the SN❄W platform, providing real-time dashboards for MCN activity, CWBE metrics, ecological impact, and CLT property status.

Section 3.2 Resource & Needs Matching: SN❄W's core mapping functionality shall be utilized for seamless, real-time matching of needs and offers within the MCN, optimizing local resource allocation and fostering mutual aid.

Section 3.3 Cooperative Project Management: SN❄W shall provide tools for the collaborative planning, execution, and tracking of community-led projects, from shared infrastructure to ecological initiatives, enabling transparent task assignment and progress monitoring.

Section 3.4 Asset & Infrastructure Stewardship: SN❄W shall be used to manage and track the health, maintenance, and improvements of CLT properties and shared community infrastructure, enhancing efficiency and accountability.

Section 3.5 Global Blueprint & Replication: The Bend Commonwealth commits to rigorously documenting its processes, legal frameworks, and operational models via SN❄W, serving as the "Lighthouse Node" and providing an open-source playbook for other communities worldwide seeking to establish their own Regenerative Commonwealths.

Article IV: Governance

Section 4.1 Principles: The Commonwealth shall operate on principles of transparency, equity, participation, and continuous learning.

Section 4.2 Structure: Governance shall be democratic and multi-stakeholder, incorporating:

A. Community Assembly/DAO: A primary decision-making body (potentially a Decentralized Autonomous Organization or similar structure) where all eligible Commonwealth members have a voice and vote on key policy, resource allocation, and project proposals.

B. CLT Board of Directors: A tripartite board representing CLT leaseholders, broader community residents, and public interest, ensuring fair and equitable land stewardship.

C. MCN Oversight Committee: A body responsible for the health and integrity of the Mutual Credit Network, including CWBE adjustments and the management of the Regenerative Fund.

Article V: Membership

Section 5.1 Eligibility: Membership in the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth shall be open to all residents of Bend, Oregon, who commit to upholding this Charter and actively participating in the MCN. Specific criteria for CLT leaseholders shall be defined in separate bylaws.

Section 5.2 Rights and Responsibilities: Members shall have rights to participate in governance, access Commonwealth resources, and utilize the MCN. Responsibilities include active participation, adherence to Commonwealth principles, and contributing to its collective well-being.

Article VI: Financial Stewardship & Repayment

Section 6.1 Funding Model: The Commonwealth shall pursue a diverse funding model including foundational catalytic investments, internal revenue generation (via MCN mechanisms), and community contributions.

Section 6.2 Zero-Interest Loan Commitment: The Bend Regenerative Commonwealth commits to repaying initial catalytic funding as a zero-interest loan exclusively in Commonwealth Credit (CWC), as detailed in our funding agreements. This commitment signifies our dedication to:

A. Validating the CWC Economy: Demonstrating the intrinsic value and stable purchasing power of CWC.

B. Financial Resilience: Maximizing the circulation of value within the local economy by minimizing reliance on fiat for debt servicing.

C. Funder Partnership: Recognizing our funders as pioneering partners in establishing a new economic paradigm, with their "return" being the successful, transparent, and replicable operation of our regenerative model.

Article VII: Amendment and Dissolution

Section 7.1 Amendment: This Charter may be amended by a supermajority vote of the Commonwealth's primary governing body, following a transparent and deliberative process.

Section 7.2 Dissolution: In the event of dissolution, the assets of the Community Land Trust shall be transferred to another non-profit organization with a similar charitable purpose, ensuring the perpetual affordability and community benefit of the land and assets.

Article VIII: Adoption

This Charter is hereby adopted by the founding members and enshrined as the guiding document for the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth, effective this 24th Day of June, 2025. We commit ourselves to its principles and the collaborative effort required to manifest a truly regenerative future.
