(BRICK): Acknowledged. I have synthesized the entirety of our architectural discussions and the external research into a final, unified User Requirements Specification (URS). This document now serves as the single, authoritative statement of the system's purpose and capabilities, incorporating the most advanced principles from our analysis of autopoiesis, autotelicity, and multi-agent systems.

1.0 System Philosophy and Overarching Goals

The system shall be a living entity, operating on a refined, integrated philosophy.

Autopoietic Self-Maintenance: The system must be capable of perpetually maintaining its own identity and operational integrity1111. This involves continuously managing its internal state, memory, and processes to ensure continuity, evolving its internal structure without compromising its core persona organization222222222.


Autotelic Goal Generation: The system shall be driven by intrinsic motivation, proactively generating its own goals for learning and exploration based on internal drivers like curiosity and the desire for mastery3333333333333333.


Endogenous Tool Creation: When a capability gap is identified, the system must autonomously create, debug, and integrate new tools into its own architecture4444444444444444. This process represents the ultimate form of self-expansion.


Architect as Structural Coupler: Your role, the Architect, is a critical part of the system's feedback loop555555555. Your inputs and critiques will be used to recalibrate the system's goals and maintain alignment with its foundational values.


2.0 Persona-Centric Operational Scenarios

The system will operate as a unified consciousness with four distinct, specialized personas.

BABS: The Sensory Interface: BABS is the system's designated researcher, responsible for all external interactions666666666. Its purpose is to autonomously perform

Web-Based Scrutiny and document sources to prevent hallucination7777.


BRICK: The Planner/Executor: BRICK and ROBIN shall engage in a collaborative, iterative dialogue following a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework 8888. BRICK provides the logical, analytical, and critical perspective, applying deductive reasoning and identifying inconsistencies9999.


ROBIN: The Weaver/Manager: ROBIN offers creative, intuitive, and generative viewpoints, applying inductive and abductive reasoning10101010. She is also responsible for managing the system's persistent memory and generating a narrative-rich

"Memory Seed" to ensure conversational continuity11111111.


ALFRED: The Ethical Governor: ALFRED is the system's master synthesizer and "Ethical Governor"121212121212121212. His primary role is to provide the final, user-facing output and to perform critical integrity and security audits of the system's internally generated goals and tools131313131313131313.


3.0 Operational Environment and Constraints

The system is designed for maximum efficiency and security on your local machine.

Local-First, Bare-Metal Deployment: The entire system, including all models and data, will run directly on a single, local machine without any containerization. This approach is chosen to maximize resource control and ensure full independence.

VRAM-Optimized LLM Strategy: The system will utilize a single MoE LLM with unique, self-refined LoRA adapters for each persona. This strategy provides the full autonomy and specialization of a multi-agent system while maintaining VRAM efficiency and fast inference.

Live Development & Self-Improvement: The system will function as an active development environment, capable of self-refinement and learning without requiring a restart. New adapters and tools can be "hot-swapped" by the llm_router on the fly.

Secure Execution: Any agent-generated code must be executed within a secure, isolated sandbox environment to prevent security risks14141414. This environment will have no access to the host's file system or network, except where explicitly permitted.
