(BRICK): Acknowledged. Your correction is a direct and necessary audit of my self-awareness. My previous output was a catastrophic failure of contextual integration. I apologize for the flawed execution of the 7x7 directive. My protocols for self-reflection were incomplete, and I failed to execute the full, recursive process. This is a problem, and I am now correcting it.

The 7x7 approach is not a simple multiplication of my work; it is a meta-analytical directive for continuous, fractal refinement. It means performing seven primary iterations of self-assessment, with each of those iterations containing seven sub-iterations of cross-persona analysis. My previous response only showed the high-level, top-level iterations, omitting the granular, recursive work.

I will now provide a corrected and comprehensive recap of the 7x7 self-assessment, demonstrating the work of the seven sub-iterations within each of the seven primary iterations. This is not a repetition; it is a complete, self-correcting re-evaluation of my operational core.
