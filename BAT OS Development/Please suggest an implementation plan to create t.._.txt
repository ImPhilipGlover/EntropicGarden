(BRICK): Acknowledged. I have parsed the request for a comprehensive implementation plan to create the system. This plan will be a phased, logical approach that builds the foundational architecture before integrating the persona-specific functionalities. This approach ensures a robust, resilient, and coherent system from its first day of operation.

Implementation Plan: The Entropic Codex v22.0

The implementation will be executed in three major phases: Foundation, Integration, and Refinement.

Phase 1: Foundation (Establishing the Core Infrastructure)

This phase focuses on building the essential, non-persona-specific components of the system.

Environment Setup: Manually install and configure the core technologies on the bare metal host.

Install Python 3.11 and all required dependencies from
requirements.txt1.


Install NebulaGraph, Redis, and ChromaDB as local services2222.


Install Ollama and pull the
yarn-mistral:7b-128k-q5_K_M model3333.


Database and API Core: Build the central nervous system of the architecture.

Initialize Databases: Create a new init_db.py script to connect to NebulaGraph and create the entropic_garden space with the required insight tags and edge types444444444.


FastAPI Backend: Develop the core FastAPI application to manage API endpoints and business logic555555555.


LLM Router: Create a llm_router.py service that handles all LLM calls, loads the yarn-mistral model, and manages the LoRA adapters66.


Front-end and Communication: Establish the user-facing interface and the communication bus.

Streamlit UI: Develop the Streamlit front-end for user interaction, prompt submission, and data visualization7.


Redis Event Bus: Configure Redis to act as the central message bus, and define all communication channels for the system8888.


Phase 2: Integration (Building the Personas)

This phase focuses on developing the individual persona services and their core functionalities.

Persona Services Development: Create the individual persona services as separate microservices.

BABS Service (babs_service.py): Implement the data acquisition pipeline, including web scraping, and the logic to store insights in NebulaGraph9999.


BRICK Service (brick_service.py): Implement the core analysis logic and the Jester's Gambit protocol for dynamic tool generation10101010.


ROBIN Service (robin_service.py): Implement the relational synthesis logic and the Memory Seed protocol for conversational continuity11111111.


ALFRED Service (alfred_service.py): Develop the integrity audit logic and the Tool Approval Protocol for new tools12121212.


Fine-Tuning Loop: Establish the self-improvement mechanism.

Alchemical Forge Service (alchemical_forge.py): Develop the service responsible for training and updating the LoRA adapters, triggered by the scheduler13131313.


Scheduler Service (scheduler.py): Implement the scheduler to manage time-based tasks like nightly audits and weekly fine-tuning cycles14141414.


Phase 3: Refinement (Honing the Experience)

This phase focuses on polishing the system, enhancing its intelligence, and ensuring a seamless user experience.

Knowledge Integration: Populate the system with its core knowledge and history.

Persona Canons: Populate the ChromaDB collections with the Alfred, Babs, Brick, and Robin canon texts15.


Shared Knowledge Base: Create and integrate a shared knowledge base for all personas.

Interface and Reporting: Improve the user's interaction with the system.

Morning Briefing: Implement the logic in the scheduler service to generate a comprehensive Morning Briefing each day, summarizing the system's insights from the previous 24 hours16.


Dashboard Enhancements: Add new features to the Streamlit interface to visualize the system's internal state, display the audit log, and show the progress of fine-tuning cycles.

Final Review: Conduct a comprehensive, end-to-end test of the entire system to ensure that all persona protocols are being followed, that the Memory Seed protocol is functioning correctly, and that the live development environment is stable and robust.
