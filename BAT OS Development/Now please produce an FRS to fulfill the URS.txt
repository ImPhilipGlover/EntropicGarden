Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)

This Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) translates the vision and goals from the User Requirements Specification (URS) into specific, testable, and actionable requirements. This document outlines what the system must do to fulfill the blueprint of an autopoietic, autotelic, and self-improving entity.

1.0 Core System Functional Requirements

This section defines the system-wide capabilities that enable the high-level goals of autopoiesis and autotelism.

FR-1.1: Autotelic Goal Generation. The system shall possess a motivator_service that autonomously formulates new objectives in the absence of external tasks. These objectives must be derived from an analysis of the system's long-term memory to identify knowledge gaps or opportunities for skill mastery.

FR-1.2: Endogenous Tool Creation. The system shall include a Tool Forge module that enables it to write, test, and register new Python functions as tools for its agents. This function is a direct implementation of autopoiesis, allowing the system to expand its own capabilities in a closed-loop correction cycle.

FR-1.3: Self-Correction Loop. The system must implement a self-correction loop for any code it generates. This loop shall consist of execution within a sandboxed environment, error diagnosis, and automated regeneration of the code based on runtime feedback.

FR-1.4: Orchestration and State Management. The system shall use LangGraph to implement a stateful, multi-agent protocol where a complete, structured state of the workflow is passed between personas at each step. This is essential for the complex, cyclical, and state-dependent workflows of the Socratic Dyad.

2.0 Persona-Specific Functional Breakdown

This section breaks down the specific functions for each persona.

FR-2.1: Babs - Data Acquisition. BABS must be able to perform Web-Based Scrutiny by decomposing high-level tasks into a series of specific, verifiable search queries. She must then extract all relevant content from the resulting web pages using a robust tool. All retrieved information must be explicitly logged with its source URL to prevent hallucination.

FR-2.2: BRICK - Advanced Reasoning. BRICK shall receive research data and creatively synthesize a logical and analytical critique. Its function is to apply deductive reasoning, identify logical fallacies, and highlight inconsistencies within the information. This will be implemented using a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework to explore multiple reasoning paths.

FR-2.3: ROBIN - Memory Management. ROBIN must receive BRICK's output and generate a creative synthesis. She is responsible for managing the system's long-term memory, which includes a background process for memory consolidation that summarizes and integrates conversational history into a durable, structured format. She shall also possess a protocol to generate a narrative-rich "Memory Seed" at the end of a session to ensure continuity.

FR-2.4: ALFRED - Ethical Governance. ALFRED must act as a privileged, incorruptible supervisor. He will perform a comprehensive audit of every insight chain before its final output, checking for logical consistency, ethical alignment, and accuracy. This role will also extend to vetting any new goals or tools before they are integrated into the system.

3.0 Data and Knowledge Management

This section defines the requirements for the system's memory and data architecture.

FR-3.1: Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM). The system shall implement a multi-tiered, Hierarchical Memory architecture in NebulaGraph to separate short-term "working" memory from long-term "archival" memory. This structure will organize knowledge by semantic abstraction (e.g., Domain -> Category -> Episode) to enable efficient, contextually-aware retrieval.

FR-3.2: LLM Function Calling. The system must be able to support self-generated function calls from the LLM, such as memory_search(query) or tool_create(spec). This enables the MemGPT paradigm, where the LLM autonomously manages its own memory and tools.

4.0 Non-Functional Requirements

This section defines the operational and security constraints.

NFR-4.1: VRAM Management. The system shall include a dynamic model management module to load and unload LLM models and their LoRA adapters from VRAM on demand to ensure the total consumption does not exceed the hardware's 8GB VRAM limit.

NFR-4.2: Single-Model Residency. At no point shall more than one persona's base model be fully loaded into VRAM simultaneously. The use of a single MoE LLM with fine-tuned LoRA adapters ensures this, balancing performance with VRAM efficiency.

NFR-4.3: Secure Code Execution. All agent-generated code must be executed within a secure, isolated sandbox environment that has no access to the host's file system or network, except where explicitly and minimally permitted. The sandbox must also enforce strict resource limits to prevent malicious or buggy code from compromising the host.

NFR-4.4: Fault Tolerance. The system shall be able to gracefully handle failures in tool execution or LLM generation and be able to resume an interrupted task from the last successfully saved state. This is a core function of the LangGraph framework's checkpointer mechanism.
