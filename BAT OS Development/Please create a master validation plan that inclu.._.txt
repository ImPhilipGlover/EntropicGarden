(BRICK): Acknowledged. I have compiled a Master Validation Plan. This document will serve as a comprehensive guide to verify the proper functioning of the Entropic Codex v22.0, ensuring all user, functional, and design requirements are met. The plan is structured to move from foundational components to complex, persona-driven interactions.

Master Validation Plan: Entropic Codex v22.0

The objective of this plan is to perform a series of tests to validate the system's core functions. Successful completion of this plan will confirm that the system operates autonomously, self-corrects, and provides a robust development environment as specified in the URS, FRS, and DDS.

1.0 Validation Scenarios

Scenario 1: Foundational Integrity: Verify that the core services (FastAPI, LLM Router, Redis, NebulaGraph, ChromaDB) start correctly on bare metal and communicate without errors.

Scenario 2: Data Ingestion and Persona Pipeline: Test the end-to-end persona pipeline, from a new file being added to the inputs folder to a final, audited insight chain in NebulaGraph.

Scenario 3: Autonomous Refinement: Validate that the system can autonomously generate a new tool, have it audited by ALFRED, and then use it in a subsequent persona interaction.

Scenario 4: Live Development and Hot-Swapping: Confirm that a change to a persona's prompt or LoRA adapter is dynamically reloaded by the llm_router without a system restart.

Scenario 5: User Interface and Interaction: Verify that the Streamlit interface can be used to submit prompts, view real-time responses, and manage system functions.

2.0 Script Generation Checklist ðŸ“‹

The following table lists every required script for the system to function properly, along with the specific requirements it fulfills and the validation tests it will undergo.

ID | Script Name | URS/FRS/DDS Requirement | Validation Test(s) | Status

F.1 | init_db.py | DDS 1.1, FRS FR-SYS-1.0 | Scenario 1: Run script and check that all databases (NebulaGraph, ChromaDB, Redis) are initialized and accessible. | â¬œ

F.2 | llm_router.py | DDS 2.1, FRS FR-SYS-2.0 | Scenario 1: Start service and verify it loads the base yarn-mistral model. | â¬œ

F.3 | fastapi_main.py | FRS FR-SYS-1.0 | Scenario 5: Start service and verify that Streamlit can connect to its API endpoints. | â¬œ

F.4 | streamlit_ui.py | URS 1.0, FRS FR-SYS-1.0 | Scenario 5: Run the Streamlit app and verify all interaction elements (input box, buttons) are functional. | â¬œ

I.1 | watcher.py | FRS FR-BABS-1.0 | Scenario 2: Place a new file in inputs and verify a message is published to Redis. | â¬œ

I.2 | babs_service.py | URS BABS.1, FRS FR-BABS-1.0 | Scenario 2: Service receives Redis event, processes file, generates an insight, and publishes it. | Scenario 2: Check NebulaGraph for source_url and retrieval_timestamp1. | â¬œ

I.3 | brick_service.py | URS BRICK.1, FRS FR-BRICK-1.0 | Scenario 2: Service receives event, processes insight, generates analysis, and publishes it. | Scenario 3: Jester's Gambit protocol is triggered, new tool is created, and an audit request is published2. | â¬œ

I.4 | robin_service.py | URS ROBIN.1, FRS FR-ROBIN-1.0 | Scenario 2: Service receives event, synthesizes insight chain, and publishes it. | Scenario 5: User triggers Memory Seed protocol, and a session summary is stored3. | â¬œ

I.5 | alfred_service.py | URS ALFRED.1, FRS FR-ALFRED-1.0 | Scenario 2: Service receives event, audits chain, and updates insight status in NebulaGraph. | Scenario 3: Service audits a new tool for safety before approving it4. | â¬œ

I.6 | scheduler.py | URS BRICK.3, FRS FR-SYS-3.0 | Scenario 2: Triggers Alfred's nightly audit. Scenario 3: Triggers fine_tuning_service for model retraining. | â¬œ

I.7 | alchemical_forge.py | FRS FR-SYS-3.0, URS SYS.3 | Scenario 4: Service receives fine-tuning request, trains a new LoRA adapter, and updates model_config.json5. | â¬œ

R.1 | model_config_updater.py | FRS FR-SYS-2.0 | Scenario 4: Service monitors model_config.json and signals the llm_router to reload adapters. | â¬œ

R.2 | persona_prompt_updater.py | FRS FR-ALFRED-1.0, URS ALFRED.2 | Scenario 2: After a failed audit, ALFRED generates a new prompt, and this script updates persona_prompts.json6. | â¬œ

R.3 | curriculum_generator.py | URS BRICK.2, URS ROBIN.1 | Scenario 2: Script autonomously generates new topics for exploration based on knowledge gaps and stores them in a designated database table. | â¬œ

R.4 | tool_executor.py | URS BRICK.2 | Scenario 3: A generic script that loads and executes approved tools from the approved directory. | â¬œ
