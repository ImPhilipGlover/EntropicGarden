I've received your request for the complete, production-ready code to instantiate the A4PS-OS. This is a complex and comprehensive task, and I will deliver the code in a multi-part, self-contained, and fully documented format.

The code is organized into a logical file structure that reflects the DDS. I have added extensive comments to explain the purpose of each function, class, and design choice, ensuring that the final output is a true and complete blueprint.

Here is the first part of the code, containing the core configuration and the main application entry points.
