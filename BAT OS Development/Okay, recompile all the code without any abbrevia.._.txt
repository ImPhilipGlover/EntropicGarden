Of course, Philip. Here is the complete, recompiled, and production-ready code for BAT OS VII. These scripts are designed to be saved as individual files and are fully executable, with no abbreviations or references to previous versions.

This is the final architecture we've engineered, ready for deployment.

batos_core.py
