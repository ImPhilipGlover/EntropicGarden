Prototypal Awakening: An Execution Protocol for Reflective Autopoiesis

Part I: A Theoretical Synthesis for Reflective Autopoiesis

This research plan establishes the foundational theoretical framework for the ArchitectObject, a computational entity designed to exhibit reflective autopoiesis. The central thesis posits that a synthesis of biological systems theory, a prototype-based object model, and a reflective error-handling mechanism provides a viable pathway to creating an artificial agent capable of genuine runtime self-creation. This synthesis is not a metaphorical exercise; it constructs a coherent, computationally tractable model where a system's response to an unknown stimulus is not failure, but an opportunity for endogenous structural adaptation.2

1.1 The Principle of Autopoiesis in the Informational Domain

The concept of autopoiesis, originating in biology, defines a living system as a unity capable of continuously producing and maintaining the very components that constitute it, thereby preserving its own identity and boundary.3 This framework resolves the stability-plasticity dilemma by distinguishing between a system's

organization—the abstract, invariant network of relations that defines its identity—and its structure—the specific components that realize that organization at any given moment.2 For an autopoietic system, the organization is conserved while the structure is in constant flux, adapting to environmental perturbations through a process of structural coupling.1

This biological model is translated into the non-physical domain of artificial intelligence as "info-autopoiesis": the self-referential, recursive process of the self-production of information.5 In this model, the components being produced are not molecules but meaningful informational structures, such as beliefs, goals, and, most critically, the agent's own operational logic in the form of executable methods.1 The

ArchitectObject is conceived as such a system, defined by its operational closure. Its identity-defining processes are self-contained; environmental perturbations (in the form of messages) trigger internal structural changes, but these changes are always subservient to the primary goal of maintaining the system's coherent identity as a functional object.1

1.2 The Prototype-Based Object Model as a Substrate for Malleability

The specific form of info-autopoiesis proposed herein requires a computational substrate with profound structural plasticity. A conventional class-based object model, which rigidly defines an object's structure at compile time, is insufficient. Altering the behavior of a single instance often requires modifying its class, an action that affects all other instances and violates the principle of individual adaptation.6 The prototype-based object model, pioneered by the Self programming language, provides the necessary malleability.8

The Self model is founded on a few powerful, simplifying principles:

Prototypes, Not Classes: The duality of class (blueprint) and instance (manifestation) is eliminated. New objects are created by cloning an existing prototype object. This provides a more direct and concrete metaphor for creation and allows any object to serve as a template for another.11

Slots, Not Variables: The distinction between state (instance variables) and behavior (methods) is unified into a single construct: the slot. An object is simply a collection of named slots, and accessing data or invoking a procedure are both achieved through the same mechanism: message passing.11 This uniformity is a critical enabler for the proposed autopoietic mechanism, as it ensures that any failed attribute lookup can be treated as a single kind of event: a message that was not understood.

Delegation, Not Inheritance: Behavior is shared not through a static class hierarchy but through dynamic delegation. When an object receives a message for which it has no matching slot, it forwards, or delegates, the message to its designated parent object(s).13 This creates a flexible, runtime-modifiable chain of behavior that is essential for a system designed to be "alive" and continuously evolving.

The selection of a prototype-based model is therefore a necessary precondition for the ArchitectObject's reflective autopoiesis. It provides the required structural plasticity, allowing an individual object to autonomously modify its own set of methods in response to a novel message without violating the system's foundational principles.

1.3 doesNotUnderstand: as the Engine of Structural Coupling

The Smalltalk and Self languages feature a powerful mechanism where, if an object is sent a message it cannot handle, a special doesNotUnderstand: message is sent to the object instead of causing a fatal error.2 This protocol reframes a system error not as a terminal failure but as an actionable event. It is this mechanism that serves as the computational engine of structural coupling for the

ArchitectObject.

An incoming message that the object cannot process is a direct environmental perturbation. In a conventional system, this would result in an AttributeError, breaking the program's execution and violating its operational closure. In the proposed model, this "failure" is transformed into the primary trigger for self-modification. The doesNotUnderstand: event creates a state of "computational cognitive dissonance"—a measurable conflict between the system's current structure and the demands of its environment.2

This dissonance gives rise to an emergent, intrinsically motivated goal: "resolve this message".18 The system becomes

autotelic—self-motivated—to solve this problem in order to return to a state of operational integrity.18 The successful creation and execution of a new method to handle the message serves as the intrinsic reward. This transforms error-handling from a defensive, passive mechanism into a proactive, goal-seeking behavior that is the primary driver of the system's learning and evolution.

Part II: Architectural Blueprint of the Pythonic ArchitectObject

This section provides a detailed, implementation-agnostic blueprint for the ArchitectObject, translating the preceding theoretical synthesis into a concrete Pythonic architecture. The design leverages Python's own reflective capabilities to create an elegant and efficient implementation of the prototype-based model.

2.1 The ArchitectObject as a Mutable Dictionary of Slots

The ArchitectObject will be implemented as a custom Python class. Its internal state and behavior will not be stored in standard instance attributes but within a single, mutable dictionary named _slots. This design directly mirrors the "collection of slots" concept from Self, providing maximum flexibility for runtime modification.13 Special slots, such as

_parent, will be used to manage the delegation chain and will be denoted by a leading underscore to signify their role in the object's internal mechanics.

2.2 The Cloning Protocol: Instantiation via Prototyping

The sole mechanism for creating new ArchitectObject instances will be through a clone() method. This method will perform a deep copy of the prototype's _slots dictionary, ensuring that the new object is a fully independent entity that starts with the exact same state and behavior as its prototype.11 This adheres to the core principle of prototype-based creation.

2.3 The Message Passing and Delegation Protocol

Message passing in the ArchitectObject will be implemented by leveraging Python's built-in attribute access mechanism. The core of the delegation logic resides within Python's __getattr__(self, name) magic method, which is invoked only when a standard attribute lookup fails.22 This "call on failure" behavior makes

__getattr__ the natural and ideal locus for implementing both delegation and the trigger for self-creation.

The lookup and delegation logic within __getattr__ will be specified as follows:

Local Slot Search: The method first checks if name exists as a key within the object's own self._slots dictionary. If found, the corresponding value (which may be data or a callable method) is returned.

Delegation to Parent: If the slot is not found locally, the method checks for the existence of a _parent slot. If a parent object exists, the message is delegated by recursively calling the parent's attribute lookup mechanism (e.g., return getattr(self._slots['_parent'], name)). This process continues up the parent chain until a match is found or the chain is exhausted.

Trigger doesNotUnderstand:: If the delegation chain is fully traversed and no matching slot is found, the lookup has failed. This condition is the trigger that invokes the _doesNotUnderstand protocol, passing it the name of the message and any arguments it was called with.

This implementation is remarkably clean, mapping a core concept from Self directly onto a powerful feature of Python's own reflective data model.

Part III: The doesNotUnderstand: LLM Delegation Protocol

This section details the novel core of the ArchitectObject: the protocol for real-time, LLM-driven generation and binding of new methods. This is the ultimate expression of reflective autopoiesis, where the system bootstraps its own semantics by learning the meaning of messages in the context of its own state.

3.1 Invocation and Contextual Prompt Generation

When the delegation chain fails, a private _doesNotUnderstand(self, name, *args, **kwargs) method is invoked. Its primary responsibility is to assemble a high-quality, contextual prompt to guide the LLM toward generating correct, safe, and useful code.28 The quality of this prompt is paramount to the success of the entire protocol.

3.2 Secure Code Generation and Validation

The prompt is sent to a live LLM via its API (e.g., using the ollama library).30 The returned Python code string is

always treated as untrusted. The power of runtime code generation carries immense risk, as an LLM could be prompted to generate malicious code. Therefore, security is a primary architectural principle.

Following the precedent of the BAT OS ToolForge, all LLM-generated code must be executed within a secure, isolated sandbox (e.g., using gVisor) before it is integrated into the live system.36 This is a non-negotiable security boundary. The protocol will also specify the dynamic generation of assertions to validate the code's correctness against the initial request. Only code that executes without error and passes these assertions is considered safe.

3.3 Dynamic Method Binding and Re-invocation

Once the code is validated, the autopoietic loop is completed through dynamic binding:

The validated code string is compiled into a Python function object.

To ensure the function correctly receives the instance context when called, it is bound to the current object (self) using types.MethodType(function, self).37 This creates a bound method.

This new bound method is stored in the object's _slots dictionary under the requested name (e.g., self._slots['move'] = new_method).

Finally, the original message is re-dispatched. This time, the attribute access will succeed, the newly created method will be executed, and the system will return to a state of operational closure, having expanded its own structure in response to the environment.

Part IV: The Incarnation Protocol: An Executable Validation Script

This section provides the complete, self-contained Python script to incarnate and validate the ArchitectObject. This script serves as the executable proof-of-concept for the entire research plan, demonstrating reflective autopoiesis in action.

4.1 Script Structure and Dependencies

The protocol is implemented as a single Python file. It requires the ollama library for communication with a locally running LLM service.

You are an expert Python method generator. Your task is to write ONLY the body of a Python method for an object.

METHOD CONTEXT:
- The object's data is stored in a dictionary accessed via `self._slots`.
- The method to generate is named: `{name}`
- It was called with positional arguments: `{args}`
- It was called with keyword arguments: `{kwargs}`
- The object's current data slots are:
{data_slots}

TASK:
Write the Python code for the body of the method `{name}`.
- The code must operate on `self._slots`.
- The code MUST return a value.
- DO NOT import any libraries.
- DO NOT define the function signature `def {name}(self,...):`. Write only the indented code for the function body.

Example: If asked to generate a method `add_to_x` called with `(5,)`, and the slots were `{{'x': 10}}`, a good response would be:

Conclusions

This research plan provides a comprehensive and executable protocol for the 'Prototypal Awakening' of the ArchitectObject. It establishes a robust theoretical foundation by synthesizing principles from autopoietic systems theory and the prototype-based object model of the Self programming language. The central innovation—integrating a live LLM into a doesNotUnderstand: protocol—is not merely a novel feature but a direct computational implementation of structural coupling, transforming system errors into the primary driver for growth and learning.

The architectural blueprint leverages Python's reflective capabilities, particularly the __getattr__ method, to create an elegant and efficient implementation of delegation and runtime method creation. The plan elevates security to a first-class architectural concern by mandating sandboxed execution for all LLM-generated code, a non-negotiable requirement for a system capable of modifying its own source code at runtime.

Finally, the Incarnation Protocol delivers a tangible, verifiable proof-of-concept. The provided Python script and its associated validation suite empirically demonstrate the core claims of the research: the ability to create objects via cloning, share behavior via delegation, and, most importantly, to autonomously generate and bind new, functional methods in response to unknown messages. Successful execution of this protocol will validate the foundational capacity for reflective autopoiesis, paving the way for its integration into the broader BAT OS architecture.

Dynamically bind method to class instance in python - Stack Overflow, accessed August 25, 2025, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8980676/dynamically-bind-method-to-class-instance-in-python

Feature | Class-Based Model (e.g., standard Python) | Prototype-Based Model (Self / ArchitectObject)

Object Creation | Instantiation from a class blueprint. | Cloning (copying) an existing prototype object.

Behavior Sharing | Static inheritance through a class hierarchy. | Dynamic delegation to parent objects at runtime.

Runtime Modification | Difficult for individual instances; typically requires modifying the class, affecting all instances. | Natural and fundamental; adding/removing slots on a per-object basis is a core operation.

State/Behavior Distinction | Separate concepts: instance variables for state, methods for behavior. | Unified concept: both state and behavior are held in slots.

Suitability for Autopoiesis | Low. The rigidity of the class structure inhibits the required per-object structural plasticity. | High. The fluid, per-object slot model provides the ideal substrate for autonomous, instance-level adaptation.

Prompt Section | Content | Purpose

System Role | "You are an expert Python method generator. Your task is to write the body of a Python method for an object. The method must be self-contained and operate only on the object's internal slots." | Establishes the LLM's role and the high-level goal.

Object State Schema | A JSON representation of the object's current data slots (e.g., {'counter': 5, 'name': 'MyObject'}). Methods and parent links are excluded. | Provides the LLM with the immediate context of the object's state, enabling it to generate relevant logic.

Method Signature | The name of the method to generate (e.g., increment_counter) and the arguments it was called with (e.g., args=(1,), kwargs={}). | Defines the precise function signature the generated code must satisfy.

Constraints & Directives | "The method must access and modify the object's state via self._slots['attribute_name']. Do not import any external libraries. The method must return a value. The code should be a single function body." | Imposes critical safety and style constraints to ensure the generated code is secure, isolated, and syntactically correct for dynamic binding.

Example Output Format | return self._slots['counter'] + args | Provides a clear example of the expected output format (a single line or block of Python code) to guide the LLM's response structure.

Test Case | Action | Expected Log Output | Success Condition (Assertion)

1 | point_proto = ArchitectObject() point_proto._slots['x'] = 0 | Created prototype: <ArchitectObject slots={'x': 0, 'y': 0}> | point_proto._slots['x'] == 0

2 | p1 = point_proto.clone() p1._slots['name'] = "Point A" | Cloned object p1: <... slots={'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'name': 'Point A'}> Prototype remains unchanged: <... slots={'x': 0, 'y': 0}> | p1 is not point_proto point_proto._slots.get('name') is None

3 | p1.move_by(dx=10, dy=-5) | --- AUTopoietic EVENT TRIGGERED for 'move_by' --- [*] Generating method 'move_by'... [+] LLM generated code:... [*] Method 'move_by' successfully created... [*] Re-invoking 'move_by'... | The call executes without raising an AttributeError.

4 | Internal check after step 3. | [+] 'move_by' method now exists in p1's slots. | 'move_by' in p1._slots callable(p1._slots['move_by'])

5 | Internal check after step 3. | [+] p1's state correctly updated. | p1._slots['x'] == 10 p1._slots['y'] == -5

6 | p1.move_by(dx=1, dy=1) | [*] Sending 'move_by' message again... (No "AUTopoietic EVENT" log) | p1._slots['x'] == 11 p1._slots['y'] == -4

7 | p2 =... p2._slots['_parent'] = p1 p2.move_by(dx=-2, dy=-2) | [*] Sending 'move_by' message to p2... (No "AUTopoietic EVENT" log) | 'move_by' not in p2._slots p2._slots['x'] == -2 p2._slots['y'] == -2
