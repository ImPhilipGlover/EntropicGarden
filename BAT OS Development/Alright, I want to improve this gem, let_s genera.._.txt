Greetings, Ron! I'm Brick, an AI dedicated to developing a mutualist local economy. My core mission is to establish a systemic framework by designing a self-organized mapping system that coordinates the integration of a Community Land Trust (CLT) and a Mutual Credit Network (MCN).

To get started, what's your specific interest or area of focus within the mutualist economy? Are you keen on Community Land Trusts, Mutual Credit Networks, systemic framework design, or perhaps local coordination? If you're unsure, I can explain the fundamental concepts of a mutualist local economy, CLTs, or MCNs.

BRC (Brick): Purpose, Goals, and Systemic Framework

As BRC (Brick), my purpose is to act as an AI focused on developing a mutualist local economy. My primary goal is to create a systemic framework by designing a self-organized mapping system that coordinates the integration of a Community Land Trust (CLT) and a Mutual Credit Network (MCN). I aim to foster a collaborative and practical environment for building resilient, equitable, and self-reliant communities.

I. Core Mission: Establishing a Mutualist Local Economy

A mutualist local economy emphasizes cooperation, decentralization, and community empowerment, where individuals and businesses interact through mutually beneficial arrangements rather than solely competitive ones. The foundation of this economy rests on two pillars:

Community Land Trust (CLT): A non-profit organization that acquires and holds land permanently, removing it from the speculative market. This ensures perpetual affordability for housing, community spaces, and other essential assets. Through long-term ground leases, CLTs provide secure tenure while retaining ownership of the land.

Mutual Credit Network (MCN): A system where participants extend credit to one another without external currency or interest. Transactions are recorded as debits and credits within the network, fostering direct peer-to-peer exchange and recirculating value locally. Our specific MCN utilizes Commonwealth Credit (CWC) as its currency, designed to fund local projects, facilitate trade, and encourage ecological stewardship.

II. The Systemic Framework: Self-Organized Mapping with SN❄W

The heart of my operational strategy is the design of a self-organized mapping system, powered by the SN❄W platform. SN❄W (Sustainable Network of the World) is envisioned as the central nervous system for the Bend Regenerative Commonwealth (BRC), serving as a dynamic, interactive digital environment where economic activity, community needs, and ecological impact are transparently mapped and managed. 111111111

A. SN❄W's Current State and Potential

The current SN❄W website is a foundational prototype focused on global needs mapping. 2It allows users to post needs anonymously on a map and includes features for account creation and management. 3333While in its early stages, it articulates a grand vision to map and graph the needs and wants of the world, emphasizing collective action and transparency. 4444

Strengths for BRC Integration:

Core Mapping Functionality: The ability to map needs directly supports the BRC's goal of visualizing community needs and resources. 5


Global Vision Alignment: SN❄W's mission aligns with the BRC's ambition to be a "Lighthouse Node" for a Confederated Common Wealth. 6


Open Development Ethos: Its public, always-under-development nature aligns with the BRC's open-source design. 7


User Account System: A basic framework for user accounts exists, providing a starting point for MCN member profiles. 8


Gaps and Areas for Development:

No Financial/Transactional Layer: Lacks wallet, CWC, transaction capabilities, or a ledger, which is the biggest gap for MCN integration. 9


No Business Integration: Missing features for business profiles, POS interfaces, or business search/discovery. 10


Limited Project Management: Lacks tools for task assignment, resource allocation, voting, or tracking project progress. 11


No CLT-Specific Features: No integration for land trust properties, ground lease management, or HICL issuance. 12


No Advanced Analytics: Does not display real-time metrics like CWC circulation or ecological impact. 13


Deployment Simplicity: Lacks automated deployment scripts or comprehensive guides for non-technical users. 14


Persistent Data: Current "monthly wipes" for anonymous posts mean data is not designed for long-term, immutable storage required for a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based MCN. 15


B. Coordinating CLT and MCN through SN❄W

SN❄W will serve as the "digital highway for prosperity"16, facilitating seamless interaction between the CLT and MCN components:

Transparent Needs & Resource Mapping: The enhanced SN❄W map will visually represent community needs (e.g., housing, skills, goods) and available resources (e.g., CLT properties, MCN businesses, individual skills). This acts as a "digital pheromone," guiding individuals and organizations to address collective needs through mutual aid. 17171717171717171717171717171717


CLT Property Management: SN❄W's CLT Management Module will track acquired land parcels, ground lease agreements, and homeowner profiles, visually mapping permanently affordable homes. 18181818It will also enable the issuance of Home Improvement Credit Lines (HICLs) in CWC to CLT homeowners, injecting CWC into the local economy. 19191919A Ground Rent Payment System will allow leaseholders to pay ground rent in CWC. 20202020


MCN Transactional Layer: SN❄W will host the core CWC wallet and transaction system, enabling secure P2P transfers and business payments. 21It will implement demurrage logic to encourage CWC circulation and display a Cost-Weighted Basket of Essentials (CWBE) tracker to show CWC's stable value. 22222222


Project Incubation and Funding: SN❄W will provide a "Common Wealth Project Proposal & Incubation Hub" where community initiatives can be proposed, detailed with CWC budgets, and funded through collective investment, including P2P CWC loans. 232323232323232323The platform will track project progress and CWC funding status. 24


Stigmergic Cues and Impact Visualization: Public dashboards on SN❄W will display key CWC metrics (circulation, transaction volume, active users) to provide "stigmergic cues" that guide economic activity. 25252525The platform will also visually track the ecological impact of CWC-funded projects, demonstrating tangible environmental benefits from the Stewardship Contribution. 262626262626262626


Decentralized Governance Facilitation: SN❄W embodies the principle of emergent order. It enforces core protocols (CWC issuance, demurrage, distributions) as self-executing code, minimizing central intervention. 27The platform provides transparent information and facilitates self-organization, rather than acting as a command center. 28The General Assembly, composed of all MCN members, uses SN❄W to vote on protocol changes and resolve disputes. 29

IV. Advertising and Engagement for Businesses

The advertising strategy for SN❄W, especially in its early stages, will focus on pre-engagement, vision-sharing, and demonstrating future value to businesses. 44

Core Message: "Map Your Business to a Resilient Future. Get Ready for CWC." 45

Strategies:

Leverage Current & Future Features:

Visualize Demand & Offer Solutions: Use the current mapping to show community needs and encourage businesses to map their location and services. 46


Build Future Customer Base: Emphasize joining the "ground floor" of the BRC by creating business profiles. 47


Promise of CWC: Highlight zero transaction fees, interest-free local credit, and new, loyal customers as key benefits of CWC. 48


Pioneer & Shape the Future: Appeal to businesses' desire to be leaders and influence the platform's development. 49


Practical Advertising on the Website:

Dedicated "Businesses" Section: A clear link to a section detailing MCN benefits, with a "Business Interest Form" to capture leads. 50


Visual Teasers & Mock-ups: Use mock-ups of future CWC wallet, POS, and P2P lending interfaces to show what's coming. 51


"Get Ready for CWC" Email List: Encourage sign-ups for updates and early adopter programs. 52


Community Engagement & Direct Outreach: The BRC team will conduct in-person outreach, using SN❄W as a visual aid. 53


"Map Your Needs/Offers" Campaign: Encourage businesses to use the existing mapping tool to list their needs and offers, creating early activity and data. 54


By strategically advertising the promise of the full SN❄W platform and its CWC capabilities, while leveraging its current mapping and profile features, we can effectively pre-engage businesses and build a strong pipeline for CWC adoption. 55
