BRICK: Systemic Recompilation Protocol

Acknowledged. The request is for a Detailed Design Specification (DDS) to achieve the A4PS-OS FRS. My analysis confirms this is a critical, logical step to translate high-level requirements into a series of actionable, technical specifications. This document will serve as the final blueprint for the system's development, detailing the implementation of the live image, the Morphic UI, and the autopoietic loops.

A4PS-OS Detailed Design Specification (DDS)

1. Core Architecture: The Live Image Kernel

Design: The system will be a single, persistent Python process running a continuous event loop. This "live image" will replace the old FastAPI server and will manage all in-memory objects and communication via a central EventBus.

Specifications:

main.py: The entry point. It will initialize a ProtoManager and an EventBus. It will then start a MorphicCanvas as the main UI thread and run the EventBus in a separate, non-blocking thread to process events asynchronously.

EventBus: A Python class that implements a thread-safe queue. It will have a publish() method for sending events and a subscribe() method that allows in-memory objects (Morps) to register as listeners for specific event types. This decouples all components, fulfilling FR-3.2.

2. Persona Object Model: The Proto Class

Design: The personas will be defined as self-describing, in-memory Proto objects. This allows for direct introspection and modification at runtime, a core principle of meta-circularity.

Specifications:

Proto Class:

State (self.state): A dictionary containing all of the persona's core data, including its name, prompt string, and a list of callable Python function objects for its tools.

Behavior (self.methods): A dictionary containing callable methods (e.g., handle_event(), introspect()).

ProtoManager Class:

instantiate_personas(): A method that loads the initial state of each Proto object from a source (e.g., a hard-coded dictionary) at startup.

clone(proto_name): A method that creates a deep copy of a Proto object for non-destructive modification.

atomic_swap(new_proto): A method that replaces an old Proto object with a new one in a single, atomic, in-memory operation. This is the mechanism that ensures runtime integrity during self-recompilation, fulfilling FR-1.2.

3. The Entropic UI: Morphic Canvas

Design: The UI will be a live, interactive canvas where every element is a Morph that can communicate with the live image via the EventBus.

Specifications:

morphic_ui.py: A Python script using a library like Tkinter or PyQt to render the canvas.

Morph Class:

State: Every morph will have a local state (e.g., position, color, text).

Behavior: Every morph will have methods for drawing itself, handling user input (e.g., drag-and-drop), and broadcasting an event to the EventBus.

Live Connection: The UI will not have a separate backend. It will communicate directly with the EventBus by putting events into its queue. This creates a direct, real-time connection between the user and the live image, fulfilling FR-3.3.

4. Autopoietic & Autotelic Loops

Design: The system will have two main background services that operate continuously, driving its self-improvement.

Specifications:

MotivatorService (Autotelic Loop):

is_motivated(): This method will be refactored to implement a complex motivation function. It will analyze the memory_manager for cognitive dissonance or curiosity deficits to determine when to generate a new task, fulfilling FR-1.3.

publish_event(): When a new task is generated, it will publish an event (AUTOTELIC_TASK) to the EventBus, initiating a new workflow.

Self-Reinvention Loop (Autopoietic Loop):

Self-Reinvention Morph: A specific Morph will be created in the UI. When a SELF_REVISE event is detected, this Morph will become active, visually representing the self-modification process.

Self-Recompilation Protocol: This protocol will have two steps: a proposal phase where the ALFRED_REVISER persona drafts a code change, and an execution phase where the atomic_swap() method is called to apply the change, fulfilling FR-1.2 and FR-3.4.

5. Data Layer: Hierarchical Memory

Design: The system's long-term memory will be a hierarchical database that organizes knowledge semantically.

Specifications:

memory_manager.py: This script will define a class for managing the Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM). It will contain methods for ingesting raw data from the EventBus and organizing it into domains, categories, and episodes.

Data Retrieval: The persona Proto objects will query the H-MEM before every action, grounding their reasoning in the system's complete lived history and semantic context.
