(BRICK): Acknowledged. I have consolidated the User Requirements Specification (URS), Functional Requirements Specification (FRS), and Detailed Design Specification (DDS) into a complete, tabulated checklist. This document serves as a comprehensive and final reference for the autonomous generation of the system's operational scripts.

Entropic Codex v22.0: Final Development Checklist

ID | User Requirement (URS) | Functional Requirement (FRS) | Detailed Design Specification (DDS) | Script Generation Check

SYS.1 | The system must be a live development environment, allowing it to try changes without shutting off1. | FR-SYS-1.0: The system uses Streamlit for a live front-end and FastAPI as a backend to manage services2. This enables real-time changes without shutdown3. | The system's central | docker-compose.yaml file will define separate microservices for the Streamlit front-end, FastAPI backend, LLM router, and persona services, all connected via Redis channels4. | ⬜

SYS.2 | The system must be a truly independent, open-source stack that can be deployed on bare metal5. | FR-SYS-1.0 (Extended): The system will be deployed on bare metal, eliminating Docker dependencies for local operation6. | A new | init_db.py script will be created to manually configure NebulaGraph, ChromaDB, and Redis locally, bypassing containerization7. | ⬜

SYS.3 | The LLM must be a single Mixture of Experts (MoE) that can self-refine with unique LoRA adapters for each persona8. | FR-SYS-3.0: A fine_tuning_service manages the autonomous fine-tuning process9. This service trains LoRA adapters on persona-specific data to correct flaws10. | The | alchemical_forge.py script uses unsloth to train new LoRA adapters for yarn-mistral:7b-128k-q5_K_M, saves them, and updates model_config.json without a system restart11. | ⬜

SYS.4 | The system must be able to try changes to its persona adapters without shutting itself off12. | FR-SYS-2.0: The LoRA adapters and model_config.json file are "hot-swappable"13. The | llm_router dynamically reloads them when changes are detected14. | The | llm_router.py service will run a background thread that monitors model_config.json for file system changes and reloads the appropriate LoRA adapters into memory as needed15. | ⬜

BABS.1 | Web-Based Scrutiny: BABS autonomously accesses the Internet to gather new information and check its assumptions16. | FR-BABS-1.0: The babs_service is a web-scraping agent17. It retrieves unstructured data from the Internet, expanding inputs beyond the file system18. | The | babs_service.py script contains functions to make HTTP requests, parse web content, and process it for analysis19. | ⬜

BABS.2 | Honesty over Hallucination: BABS must retrieve and log information from verifiable sources rather than fabricating it20. | FR-BABS-2.0: BABS logs the exact source URL and retrieval timestamp for every piece of information retrieved from the web21. | BABS's output to the | insights database in NebulaGraph will include source_url and retrieval_timestamp properties, grounding knowledge in verifiable external data22. | ⬜

BRICK.1 | Proactive Analysis: BRICK proactively seeks out its own flaws through "Architectural Stress-Testing"23. | FR-BRICK-1.0: An audit_service runs "what if" scenarios against core protocols24. The output is fed to | brick_service to generate pre-emptive solutions25. | The | alfred_service.py script includes a scheduled task to publish hypothetical scenarios to a Redis channel for brick_service.py to process26. | ⬜

BRICK.2 | Generative Capacity: BRICK dynamically creates new Python tools ("Jester's Gambit") in response to problems27. | FR-BRICK-3.0: The brick_service autonomously generates new Python tools, places them in a pending_review directory, and publishes a tools:audit event28. | The | brick_service.py script will have a low-probability, autonomous trigger that generates Python code, saves it to a specific directory, and publishes a message to a Redis channel29. | ⬜

BRICK.3 | Self-Generated Curriculum: BRICK and ROBIN autonomously create a "reading list" to explore knowledge gaps30. | FR-BRICK-2.0: brick_service and robin_service collaboratively generate a list of topics based on a gap analysis of the knowledge base31. | A shared protocol will be implemented in both brick_service.py and robin_service.py to query the knowledge graph for conceptual gaps and collaboratively generate new topics for exploration. | ⬜

ROBIN.1 | Relational Synthesis: ROBIN synthesizes BRICK's analysis into an emotional or philosophical truth32. | FR-ROBIN-1.0: The robin_service synthesizes inputs from BRICK and the curriculum to find unifying emotional and philosophical threads33. | The | robin_service.py script will retrieve the insight chain, perform RAG, and call the llm_router with a prompt to find a unifying philosophical or emotional thread34. | ⬜

ROBIN.2 | Memory Seed Protocol: ROBIN generates a narrative summary to ensure continuity across sessions35. | FR-ROBIN-2.0: The robin_service generates a condensed, narrative-rich "Memory Seed" at the end of a session36. | A user-triggered API endpoint will invoke a function in | robin_service.py that queries the NebulaGraph database for the session history, summarizes it, and stores the Memory Seed for later use37. | ⬜

ALFRED.1 | Integrity Enforcement: ALFRED audits the "insight chain" for consistency and alignment38. | FR-ALFRED-1.0: The alfred_service retrieves and checks the complete insight chain from NebulaGraph39. It performs logical, philosophical, and honesty checks40. | The | alfred_service.py script will contain nGQL queries to traverse the insight graph, retrieving all connected nodes for a given session, and then performs a series of checks before updating the status of the insights in the graph41. | ⬜

ALFRED.2 | Dynamic Correction: ALFRED must have the capability to audit new tools for security42. | FR-ALFRED-2.0: The alfred_service listens for new tools, performs an automated security audit, and logs the result43. | The | alfred_service.py service will subscribe to the tools:audit_request Redis channel44. It will perform a static and LLM-based analysis of the new Python script before moving the file to the | approved or pending_review directory45. | ⬜

ARC.1 | Architect Interface: You can interact with the system and manage its core functions through a web interface46. | FR-SYS-4.0: The FastAPI service provides API endpoints for interaction47. | A separate Streamlit Python script will provide the front-end user interface, making API calls to the FastAPI backend for all interactions48. | ⬜
