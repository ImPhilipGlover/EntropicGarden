Of course. Having defined the architecture, the next logical step is to design the primary user interface through which the community will interact with it.

(ROBIN): Yes! We have drawn the beautiful blueprints for our home, and now we get to design the doors, the windows, and the comfortable armchairs. We must think about how it will feel to walk through these digital rooms. Will it feel welcoming? Will it feel simple? Will it feel like a place where you can truly connect with your neighbors? This is a wonderful and important task.

(BRICK): Acknowledged. The user is requesting a high-level product design for the FLAKES user interface, to be implemented as an integrated module ("bolt-on") for the existing SNOW Atlas website. The design must be user-centric, adhere to the principles of the v31.3 architecture, and facilitate all core economic and governance functions.

The following is the functional design specification for the FLAKES Integrated Module.

FLAKES Integrated Module: Functional Design Specification

1. Core Design Philosophy

1.1. Bolt-on, Not Built-over: The FLAKES module will not replace the SNOW Atlas; it will enrich it. The existing Atlas map is the foundational "geographical layer." FLAKES will add a "live economic layer" on top of it, integrating all financial and governance interactions directly into the map-based interface.

1.2. Radical Simplicity & Progressive Disclosure: The interface will be designed to be immediately usable by a non-technical member. Complex features will be revealed contextually, not presented all at once. The goal is to make a deeply complex system feel intuitive and simple.

1.3. Stigmergy in Action: Every major user interface element will be designed as a "signal" that a user leaves in the environment for others to act upon. The UI is not just for consuming information, but for creating actionable social and economic data.

2. The User Dashboard: "The Hearth"

This is the user's personalized home screen, their "front porch" to the Commonwealth. It prioritizes clarity and immediate personal relevance.

2.1. My Wallet: A clean, graphical display showing:

Current Balance: The user's positive FLKS balance.

Available Credit: The user's current negative balance limit, visualized as a "trust-based" line of credit from the community.

Simple Actions: Large, clear buttons for "Send" and "Request" FLKS.

2.2. My Jubilee Stream (UBD): A dedicated widget that makes the UBD tangible.

Displays the amount of the last UBD payment received.

Shows a simple, visual countdown to the next UBD distribution.

Purpose: To constantly reinforce the principle of the "Perpetual Jubilee" and the direct benefit of participating in the commons.

2.3. My Provenance (Reputation):

A visual summary of the user's Reputation Ledger.

It will prominently feature recently earned 'Weaver's Credentials', perhaps as little glowing threads in a tapestry, to celebrate and encourage pro-social staking.

2.4. Notification Center: An inbox-style list of actionable updates, such as "Your stake in the 'Community Garden' project was successful!" or "You have received a new 'Weaver's Credential'."

3. The Atlas Interface: "The Commons"

This is the primary interactive space, where the economy happens.

3.1. Economic Layers: The Atlas map will have simple, toggle-able layers:

Needs Layer: Members can drop a pin on the map to post a need (e.g., "Need help with childcare on Tuesday").

Offers Layer: Members can drop a pin to post an offer of a good or service.

Projects Layer: Displays all active 'Universal Staking' projects (e.g., "Fund the new tool library").

3.2. Staking Interface: Clicking a "Project" pin opens a simple pop-up.

It shows the funding goal, the amount raised, and a simple slider or input box labeled "Stake Your FLKS."

A large, clear button confirms the stake. The process is designed to feel like a simple, powerful vote.

3.3. Leasehold Auction Interface: Clicking a highlighted property pin on the map opens the 'Community Pledged Capital' auction interface.

It shows the current high bid and the time remaining.

It provides two clear options: "Place Your Own Bid" or "Support a Bidder," which allows a user to search for another member and stake FLKS directly to their cause.

4. Onboarding: "The Welcome Mat"

A guided, friendly experience is critical for adoption.

4.1. The 'First Bloom' Protocol: A step-by-step wizard for new users that is initiated on their first login.

Welcome: A brief, beautiful welcome from ROBIN.

Profile Setup: Helps the user create their verified identity.

First Contribution: Guides the user to post their first "Need" or "Offer" on the Atlas, giving them an immediate sense of participation.

Sandbox Transaction: Grants the user a small, temporary amount of FLKS to make their first transaction in a sandboxed, "tutorial" environment, removing the fear of making a mistake.

(ROBIN): This home we are designingâ€¦ its digital walls and windows are not meant to keep people out. They are meant to be open, to be a place of gathering. It is a design for a community that is not just efficient, but joyful; not just functional, but kind.
