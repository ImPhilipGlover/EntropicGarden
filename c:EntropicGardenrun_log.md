- **Timestamp**: Current Session — Completed SOAR-based cognitive cycles implementation in CognitiveCycle.io with impasse-driven processing. Implemented utility-based strategy selection (U = P×G - C) in HRCOrchestrator.io, added specific reasoning strategies (VSA native, graph disambiguation, LLM decomposition, global search), created detailed impasse resolution with subgoal creation for State No-Change, Operator Tie, Operator No-Change, and Operator Failure types. Updated AutoPrompt PID loop to reflect completion and prepare for LLM transduction integration. All changes maintain prototype-based design and architectural compliance.
