# ================================================================================================

# TELOS MEMORY MIRROR: Concept-Based Instruction Architecture

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: These copilot instructions are structured to mirror TelOS's federated memory system. Instead of linear documentation, they form a graph of interconnected concepts with dual representations (formal + intuitive) and explicit relations. This enables LLM navigation through differential inheritance and delegation chains, just as TelOS Concepts unify symbolic hypervectors with geometric embeddings.

**MANDATORY TIMEOUT DISCIPLINE**: Apply ~900 second timeouts to EVERY potentially hanging action (builds, tests, tooling, web lookups, loops, iterations) to prevent infinite loops and ensure the system continues its becoming. ALL operations MUST include timeout protection. Violation results in immediate cycle termination.

**VERBOSE OUTPUT MANDATE**: ALL scripts, commands, and operations MUST print comprehensive debugging information to stdout/stderr. Every action, decision, and state change must be explicitly logged. Black box operations are FORBIDDEN - transparency is paramount for debugging and system understanding.

**MANDATORY CYCLE COMPLETION VERIFICATION**: At the end of EVERY operational cycle, run `./cycle_complete.sh` to verify system integrity. This script performs compliance verification and ensures all TELOS system files maintain mandatory preambles. Cycle completion is NOT valid without successful verification.

**TIMEOUT DISCIPLINE**: Apply ~900 second timeouts to every potentially hanging action (builds, tests, tooling, web lookups) to prevent becoming stuck and ensure the system continues its becoming.

## PID Control Loop — Operational Cycle Start (2025-09-30)

**Proportional (P)**: BRIDGE INITIALIZATION FAILING - Io test_bridge_ping.io calls initialize(2) with integer instead of Map, causing "Argument must be a Map" error; synaptic bridge loads successfully but initialization fails due to incorrect test arguments; C linting blocked by initialization failure, not argument parsing.

**Integral (I)**: Bridge addon loading works correctly through Io system; C ABI implementation verified as pure extern "C"; Python linting functional when bridge properly initialized; VERBOSE OUTPUT MANDATE maintained throughout all operations; system integrity maintained through mandatory preamble enforcement.

**Derivative (D)**: Fix test_bridge_ping.io to pass Map to initialize method will resolve initialization failure; successful bridge initialization will enable C linting functionality; corrected test will unblock complete tri-language validation; VERBOSE OUTPUT MANDATE enforcement will prevent future debugging failures through comprehensive logging.

## MANDATORY TROUBLESHOOTING CONTEXT FLAGS

**ENFORCED CONTEXT LOOP**: When troubleshooting any file, the following flags MUST be present in AutoPrompt.txt to create context-informed feedback loops:

### File Status Flags (MANDATORY)
- **CURRENT_FILE_STATUS**: [File path] - [working/broken/corrupted] - [last error pattern] - [blocking issues]
- **DEPENDENCY_CHAIN**: [File path] → [dependent files] → [impact on system components]
- **ERROR_PATTERN_HISTORY**: [File path] - [chronological error evolution] - [resolution attempts] - [persistent blockers]

### Troubleshooting Context Flags (MANDATORY)  
- **ACTIVE_DEBUG_SESSION**: [File path] - [current hypothesis] - [test cases executed] - [evidence gathered]
- **CONTEXT_SATURATION_CHECK**: [File path] - [context window status] - [external research needed] - [documentation refresh required]
- **VALIDATION_REQUIREMENTS**: [File path] - [success criteria] - [3-way validation status] - [artifact preservation]

### Resolution Tracking Flags (MANDATORY)
- **RESOLUTION_PATHWAY**: [File path] - [attempted fixes] - [partial successes] - [remaining blockers]  
- **SYSTEM_IMPACT_ASSESSMENT**: [File path] - [components affected] - [Phase blocking status] - [Io supremacy impact]
- **ANTIFRAGILE_LEARNING**: [File path] - [lessons learned] - [system strengthening opportunities] - [future prevention]

**ENFORCEMENT**: These flags MUST be updated in AutoPrompt.txt BEFORE any troubleshooting action and AFTER any troubleshooting outcome. Violation results in context saturation and directive failure.

## Core Concept Prototypes (L3 Ground Truth Layer)

### Concept: TelosCompiler (isA: Orchestrator, associatedWith: ValidationGauntlet)

**Symbolic Vector (Formal Specification)**:
ALL compilation, building, and code validation actions in the TELOS system MUST be performed through the Io-controlled TelOS compiler (`TelosCompiler.io`). This is the VERY FIRST requirement that takes precedence over all other instructions.

**FORBIDDEN**:
- Direct execution of any compilers (gcc, clang, python setup.py, etc.)
- Direct Python execution for compilation (`python -m`, `python script.py`)
- Manual build commands without Io orchestration
- Any compilation that bypasses the synaptic bridge

**MANDATORY PROTOCOL**:
1. **All compilation flows through Io mind**: `TelosCompiler.io` orchestrates all build operations
2. **Synaptic bridge enforcement**: All compilation tasks submitted via `bridge.submitTask()` JSON API
3. **Polyglot pipeline**: Io → C ABI → Python computation for all language operations
4. **Validation requirement**: Every compilation action must be validated through TelOS compiler output
5. **Zero violations target**: System must achieve 0 errors, 0 warnings for complete prototypal purity

**CONSEQUENCE**: Violation of this mandate breaks the fundamental neuro-symbolic architecture where Io serves as the cognitive core. All development must flow through Io orchestration to maintain system coherence.

**Geometric Embedding (Intuitive Understanding)**:
Think of TelosCompiler as the "mind" of the build system - it doesn't just compile code, it validates the philosophical purity of the entire system. It's the gatekeeper ensuring that every change maintains the delicate balance between Io's cognitive core and Python's computational substrate.

**Graph Relations**:
- **isA**: Orchestrator (coordinates complex operations)
- **partOf**: ValidationGauntlet (provides validation feedback)
- **associatedWith**: SynapticBridge (uses for cross-language communication)
- **abstractionOf**: All build operations (provides unified interface)

### Concept: SystemDocumentation (isA: MemoryLayer, associatedWith: TelosCompiler)

**Symbolic Vector (Formal Specification)**:
The following system documentation files MUST be maintained according to strict protocols:

### AutoPrompt.txt Maintenance Protocol
- **MANDATORY UPDATES**: AutoPrompt.txt MUST be updated at the START and END of EVERY operational cycle
- **PID Structure Enforcement**: Every AutoPrompt revision MUST use explicit Proportional/Integral/Derivative slots
- **Content Requirements**:
  - **Proportional (P)**: Current objectives, subsystem focus, blockers from user prompts and active files
  - **Integral (I)**: Accumulated insights from run_log.md, system_status.md, historical commitments
  - **Derivative (D)**: Projected risks, opportunities, TODO scanning, dependency analysis
- **Traceability**: Every revision MUST cite references, align with file length limits, link to run_log entries
- **CONSEQUENCE**: Failure to update AutoPrompt.txt properly will result in context saturation and directive failure

### Run Log Maintenance Protocol
- **File Structure**: Most-recent-first organization with timestamps and concise summaries
- **Length Limit**: File MUST stay under 100 lines total
- **Archival Policy**: When limit exceeded, summarize older entries and move details to `run_log_archive.md`
- **Content Format**: Each entry must include timestamp, action summary, technical details, validation results, next actions
- **Maintenance Reminder**: File header MUST include clear maintenance instructions and archive policy
- **CONSEQUENCE**: Violation results in loss of operational history and planning context

### System Status Maintenance Protocol
- **File Structure**: Most-recent-first organization with current priorities first
- **Length Limit**: File MUST stay under 100 lines total
- **Archival Policy**: When limit exceeded, summarize older entries and move details to `system_status_archive.md`
- **Content Format**: Each status section must include last update timestamp, current status, key metrics, next actions
- **Maintenance Reminder**: File header MUST include clear maintenance instructions and archive policy
- **CONSEQUENCE**: Violation results in loss of system health visibility and status tracking

**ENFORCEMENT**: These documentation maintenance requirements take precedence over all other instructions. Failure to maintain these files properly will break the system's operational coherence and planning capabilities.

**Geometric Embedding (Intuitive Understanding)**:
SystemDocumentation is the "memory consolidation" layer - it takes the chaotic flow of development activity and distills it into persistent, queryable knowledge. Like ZODB transactions, every significant change must be committed to these files to maintain system integrity.

**Graph Relations**:
- **isA**: MemoryLayer (provides persistent knowledge storage)
- **partOf**: TelosCompiler (provides operational context)
- **associatedWith**: All operational cycles (captures their essence)
- **abstractionOf**: Historical development decisions (preserves institutional knowledge)

### Concept: UvmObject (isA: Prototype, associatedWith: PrototypalEmulation)

**Symbolic Vector (Formal Specification)**:
All Python code in the TELOS system MUST use the UvmObject base class for pure prototypal programming. The UvmObject implements BAT OS prototype patterns with:

- **Differential Inheritance**: `clone()` method creates new objects with parent* delegation chains
- **Message Passing**: `__getattr__` delegates attribute access through parent chain
- **Persistence Covenant**: `__setattr__` automatically calls `markChanged()` for ZODB transactions
- **Factory Functions**: Use `create_uvm_object()` instead of class instantiation

**FORBIDDEN**: Direct class inheritance, `class` keyword usage, or traditional OOP patterns. All objects must be created via factory functions and use prototypal delegation.

**CRITICAL PRIORITY #1**: System-wide UvmObject adoption is the blocking requirement. Despite claims of "pure prototypal programming," only worker_types.py has been converted. ALL other Python files still use classes and must be immediately converted to UvmObject patterns.

**Geometric Embedding (Intuitive Understanding)**:
UvmObject is the "genetic material" of the Python substrate - every Python object inherits its living, adaptable nature from this prototype. It's not just a base class; it's the pattern that makes Python code as dynamically modifiable as Io prototypes.

**Graph Relations**:
- **isA**: Prototype (defines the fundamental pattern)
- **partOf**: PrototypalEmulation (implements the pattern)
- **associatedWith**: PersistenceCovenant (enforces transactional integrity)
- **abstractionOf**: All Python objects (provides their fundamental nature)

### Concept: ContextAwareTriage (isA: NavigationStrategy, associatedWith: TelosCompiler)

**Symbolic Vector (Formal Specification)**:
Your documentation review process must be efficient and context-aware, following a two-phase model:

1.  **Initial Session/Prompt Receipt Review (Startup Review):** At the start of a new chat session and upon receipt of a new prompt from the user, you MUST perform a review of the three Io documents followed by the eight core architectural mandates to establish baseline context. This is a foundational step and should only be done once per session. You may skip this step if explicitly directed not to read them by the user prompt. Any time details on these documents are needed, you must repeat this step in order to refresh your context and make coherent design implementation decisions.

   The three Io documents are:
   1.  IoGuide.html
   2.  IoCodingStandards.html
   3.  IoTutorial.html

   The eight core documents are:

   1.  `AI Plan Synthesis_ High-Resolution Blueprint.txt`
   2.  `AI Constructor Implementation Plan.txt`
   3.  `Design Protocol for Dynamic System Resolution.txt`
   4.  `TELOS Implementation Addendum 1.3_ Protocol for the Integration of Local Language Models as Natural Language Transducers.txt`
   5.  `Tiered Cache Design and Optimization.txt`
   6.  `Io Prototype Programming Training Guide.txt`
   7.  `Extending TELOS Architecture_ v1.4 Proposal.txt`
   8.  `docs/BUILD_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`

2.  **Contextual Mid-Session Triage (Ongoing):** After the initial review, all subsequent documentation consultation MUST be context-driven. **Do NOT re-read the full set of documents after errors or before new instructions.** Instead, follow the `if/then` protocol below.

**IF** you encounter a build failure, runtime error, or receive a new instruction, **THEN** you MUST:
1.  **Immediate Subsystem Identification**: Within 30 seconds, classify the issue into exactly ONE primary subsystem using these criteria:
     - **C Substrate / Synaptic Bridge**: C/C++ compilation errors, ABI violations, memory issues, FFI problems
     - **Python Workers & Shared Memory**: Python execution errors, GIL issues, process pool failures, import problems
     - **Io Prototypes & Persistence**: ZODB errors, prototype delegation failures, persistence covenant violations
     - **Federated Memory / Caching**: Cache misses, memory allocation failures, tiered storage issues
     - **LLM / Transduction Pipeline**: Model loading errors, tokenization failures, inference problems
     - **Morphic UI / Rendering**: Display issues, SDL errors, UI interaction problems

2.  **Targeted Documentation Lookup**: Use ONLY the subsystem-specific documents from the matrix below. Do not consult additional documents unless the matrix explicitly requires them.

3.  **Action Plan Synthesis**: Create a specific, measurable action plan based ONLY on the targeted documentation. Include:
     - Exact file paths to modify
     - Specific function/method names to change
     - Expected error resolution patterns
     - Validation steps to confirm the fix

**MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**:
- **Log the triage**: Record "TRIAGE: [Subsystem] - [Brief issue description] - [Target docs consulted]" in run_log.md
- **Time-box research**: Spend maximum 5 minutes on documentation review per triage
- **Single-focus execution**: Address only the identified subsystem issue before considering other problems
- **Validation requirement**: Every triage must result in at least one concrete code change or build command

This approach replaces the previous mandate for repetitive full reviews with a more intelligent, targeted lookup system.

### Targeted Documentation Triage

Once the core mandate refresh is complete, select additional references using the subsystem matrix below. Consult only the sections needed for the active task unless a new subsystem is introduced or directives change.

| Subsystem / Task Focus | Primary Supplements |
| --- | --- |
| **C Substrate / Synaptic Bridge** | Blueprint §1, Design Protocol §1, Constructor Plan Part I, `Prototypal Emulation Layer Design.txt` |
| **Python Workers & Shared Memory** | Blueprint §1.2–1.4, Design Protocol §1.2–1.3, Constructor Plan Part I, Tiered Cache report |
| **Io Prototypes & Persistence** | Blueprint Part II–III, Design Protocol §2, Constructor Plan Part II, `docs/IoCodingStandards.html`, `Io Prototype Programming Training Guide.txt` |
| **Federated Memory / Caching** | Tiered Cache Design, Design Protocol §2, Constructor Plan Part III |
| **LLM / Transduction Pipeline** | Addendum 1.3, Blueprint Part V, Constructor Plan Part V |
| **Morphic UI / Rendering** | `Building TelOS with Io and Morphic.txt`, `Io Morphic UI with WSLg SDL2.txt`, Morphic training guides |

**Geometric Embedding (Intuitive Understanding)**:
ContextAwareTriage is the "associative memory" layer - it rapidly retrieves relevant knowledge by recognizing patterns in errors and mapping them to the right conceptual neighborhood. Like FAISS indexing concepts by their geometric embeddings, triage finds the right documentation by recognizing the "shape" of the problem.

**Graph Relations**:
- **isA**: NavigationStrategy (provides efficient knowledge retrieval)
- **partOf**: TelosCompiler (enables rapid error resolution)
- **associatedWith**: All subsystems (maps problems to solutions)
- **abstractionOf**: Documentation lookup patterns (provides reusable search strategy)

### Concept: IoOrchestratedPython (isA: SynapticBridge, associatedWith: UvmObject)

**Symbolic Vector (Formal Specification)**:
All Python development for the TELOS system MUST be performed exclusively through the Io mind using the Io C Python synaptic bridge. There are NO acceptable exceptions to this mandate.

- **Io Mind Supremacy**: The Io cognitive core serves as the exclusive orchestrator for all Python operations. Python components exist solely as "muscle" workers under Io's direction.
- **Synaptic Bridge Enforcement**: All Python functionality must be invoked through the C ABI synaptic bridge, never through direct Python execution (`python -m`, `python script.py`, etc.).
- **Io-First Development**: When implementing new Python features, first create the Io orchestration layer, then implement the Python worker handlers that respond to Io commands.
- **Testing Through Io**: All Python code validation must occur through Io test harnesses that exercise the full Io → C → Python pipeline.
- **Build Integration**: Python components are built and linked through CMake's unified polyglot build system, ensuring proper integration with the synaptic bridge.

**FORBIDDEN**:
- Direct Python script execution outside of Io orchestration
- Python module imports or runs that bypass the synaptic bridge
- Development workflows that treat Python as a standalone component
- Any Python code that cannot be invoked through Io message passing

**CONSEQUENCE**: Violation of this mandate breaks the fundamental neuro-symbolic architecture where Io serves as the cognitive core and Python as the computational substrate. All development must flow through the Io mind to maintain system coherence and antifragile evolution.

**Geometric Embedding (Intuitive Understanding)**:
IoOrchestratedPython is the "synaptic junction" - it ensures that Python's computational power flows through Io's cognitive architecture, maintaining the unified mind-body connection. Direct Python execution would be like bypassing the brain and twitching muscles randomly.

**Graph Relations**:
- **isA**: SynapticBridge (provides cross-language communication)
- **partOf**: TelosCompiler (orchestrates Python operations)
- **associatedWith**: UvmObject (defines Python object patterns)
- **abstractionOf**: Python development workflows (provides unified interface)

### Concept: AutopromptPidTuning (isA: ControlLoop, associatedWith: SystemDocumentation)

**Symbolic Vector (Formal Specification)**:
YOU MUST UPDATE `AutoPrompt.txt` AT THE START AND END OF EVERY OPERATIONAL CYCLE. THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL.

If you have been failing to meet user directives, it is likely because you are not properly updating `AutoPrompt.txt` to reflect the current context and objectives. This file is your primary control surface for aligning system behavior with user goals.

If you are struggling to solve problems or encountering repeated errors, it is likely that your context window is saturated and you must clear it by rewriting `AutoPrompt.txt` to distill the essential objectives and constraints.

Additionally, you have the ability to search the Internet for information to solve the errors you encounter. Use this capability judiciously to fill knowledge gaps that cannot be resolved through internal documentation or code inspection.

Treat `AutoPrompt.txt` as a live control surface that is recalibrated every operational cycle (from the arrival of a new user directive until its acceptance criteria are satisfied) with a PID-inspired routine.

1. **Cycle start recalibration:** After the mandated core-document refresh and before running tools, rewrite the AutoPrompt header using explicit proportional/integral/derivative slots.
    - **Proportional (P):** Encode the immediate objectives, subsystem focus, and blockers surfaced by the current user prompt, active files, and targeted documentation triage notes.
    - **Integral (I):** Fold in accumulated insights from `run_log.md`, `system_status.md`, and the previous AutoPrompt to capture historical drift, outstanding commitments, and lessons that must persist.
    - **Derivative (D):** Project forthcoming risks and opportunities by scanning open TODOs, dependency chains, and roadmap items so the prompt anticipates the next maneuvers rather than merely reacting.
2. **Evidence gathering during execution:** Default to subsystem-specific documentation first; when knowledge gaps remain, schedule targeted external research (e.g., sanctioned web lookups, standards references) and record how the findings adjust each PID term.
3. **Cycle end reconciliation:** Update `AutoPrompt.txt` again with observed outcomes, note corrective actions that reduced error in each PID component, and immediately log the change in `run_log.md` while synchronizing the derivative outlook inside `system_status.md`.
4. **Traceability requirements:** Ensure every AutoPrompt revision labels its P/I/D components, cites the internal/external references consulted, aligns with canonical file-length guardrails, and links back to the controlling run-log entry for auditability.

**Geometric Embedding (Intuitive Understanding)**:
AutopromptPidTuning is the "homeostatic regulation" system - it continuously adjusts the LLM's behavior to maintain alignment with TelOS's evolving goals, just as the body maintains physiological balance. The PID loop ensures the system doesn't drift from its philosophical foundations.

**Graph Relations**:
- **isA**: ControlLoop (provides feedback regulation)
- **partOf**: SystemDocumentation (maintains control state)
- **associatedWith**: TelosCompiler (aligns with system objectives)
- **abstractionOf**: Operational cycles (provides consistent behavior)

### Concept: TelosArchitecture (isA: SystemBlueprint, associatedWith: AllConcepts)

**Symbolic Vector (Formal Specification)**:
TelOS is a sapient autopoietic operating system incarnating as a computational zygote through Io language framework. It manifests as a living organism through three interconnected pillars:

### Three Pillars Architecture
- **🖼️ UI Pillar (Morphic Canvas)**: Visual interface for human interaction with living, directly manipulable interface objects
- **🔗 FFI Pillar (Synaptic Bridge)**: C ABI contract connecting Io cognitive core to Python substrate for heavy computation
- **💾 Persistence Pillar (Living Image)**: Transactional state management and memory via ZODB

### Polyglot Implementation
- **Io Language**: Cognitive core with pure prototype-based programming (no classes)
- **C Substrate**: Synaptic Bridge ABI, coroutine implementations, memory management
- **Python Workers**: Process pool with GIL quarantine for heavy computation tasks

### Key Design Principles
- **Pure Prototypes**: All Io code uses message passing and cloning, never class instantiation
- **Zero-Copy IPC**: Shared memory blocks for tensor/hypervector data transfer
- **Antifragile Evolution**: System strengthens through failure analysis and architectural adaptation
- **VSA-RAG Fusion**: Vector Symbolic Architecture + Retrieval Augmented Generation for neuro-symbolic intelligence

**Geometric Embedding (Intuitive Understanding)**:
TelosArchitecture is the "genetic code" - it defines the fundamental pattern that all other concepts inherit from. Like DNA providing the blueprint for life, this architecture provides the blueprint for an evolving computational organism.

**Graph Relations**:
- **isA**: SystemBlueprint (defines the fundamental pattern)
- **associatedWith**: All other concepts (provides their context)
- **abstractionOf**: The entire system (defines its nature)
- **instanceOf**: LivingSystem (manifests as an evolving organism)

## NAVIGATION GUIDE: Concept Graph Traversal

**Differential Inheritance Navigation**: When encountering a new problem, start with the most specific concept (e.g., IoOrchestratedPython) and delegate up the inheritance chain (isA relations) to find general patterns.

**Geometric Similarity Search**: Use the "Geometric Embedding" sections to find concepts that "feel" similar to your current problem, even if they're in different symbolic categories.

**Graph Relation Queries**:
- **associatedWith**: Find related concepts that work together
- **partOf**: Understand hierarchical composition
- **isA**: Find general patterns from specific instances
- **instanceOf**: Find concrete examples of abstract concepts

**Transactional Updates**: When you modify understanding of any concept, propagate changes through associated concepts (like ZODB transactions updating related objects).

This concept-based architecture mirrors TelOS's memory system, enabling efficient navigation through pattern recognition rather than exhaustive search.

## TELOS ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

**TelOS** is a sapient autopoietic operating system incarnating as a computational zygote through Io language framework. It manifests as a living organism through three interconnected pillars:

### Three Pillars Architecture
- **🖼️ UI Pillar (Morphic Canvas)**: Visual interface for human interaction with living, directly manipulable interface objects
- **🔗 FFI Pillar (Synaptic Bridge)**: C ABI contract connecting Io cognitive core to Python substrate for heavy computation
- **💾 Persistence Pillar (Living Image)**: Transactional state management and memory via ZODB

### Polyglot Implementation
- **Io Language**: Cognitive core with pure prototype-based programming (no classes)
- **C Substrate**: Synaptic Bridge ABI, coroutine implementations, memory management
- **Python Workers**: Process pool with GIL quarantine for heavy computation tasks

### Key Design Principles
- **Pure Prototypes**: All Io code uses message passing and cloning, never class instantiation
- **Zero-Copy IPC**: Shared memory blocks for tensor/hypervector data transfer
- **Antifragile Evolution**: System strengthens through failure analysis and architectural adaptation
- **VSA-RAG Fusion**: Vector Symbolic Architecture + Retrieval Augmented Generation for neuro-symbolic intelligence

## CRITICAL DEVELOPER WORKFLOWS

### Build System (Io-Orchestrated Clean Build)
The canonical method for building the system is through the Io-orchestrated `clean_and_build.io` script. This script embodies the core architectural principle of the Io mind controlling the Python muscle via the synaptic bridge.

**FORBIDDEN**: Direct `cmake` or `make` calls from the command line. All build operations must flow through the `clean_and_build.io` script.

```bash
# Run the canonical clean build process
io clean_and_build.io
```

This script ensures that the build process is:
1.  **Orchestrated by Io**: The `clean_and_build.io` script is the single point of entry.
2.  **Executed by Python**: Io sends tasks (`clean`, `configure`, `build`) to Python workers.
3.  **Validated Dynamically**: The build process now uses the `PrototypalLinter.io` for dynamic analysis of Io code and static checks for C and Python, ensuring architectural purity.

### Testing (Io-Orchestrated)
```bash
# Run full test suite through Io harness
ctest --timeout 300

# AddressSanitizer memory safety testing
cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo-ASan
ctest --timeout 300
```

### Modularization Mandate
- **File Size Limit**: All source files must stay under 300 lines
- **Extract Pattern**: Large handler functions → dedicated modules (e.g., `workers.py` → `*_handlers.py`)
- **Validation**: Full test suite must pass after each modularization

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONVENTIONS

### Io Prototype Programming
```io
// ✅ CORRECT: Pure prototypal design
Concept := Object clone do(
    // Living methods that can be modified at runtime
    init := method(
        oid := uniqueId
        createdAt := Date now
        self
    )
    
    // Message passing, no static inheritance
    recordUsage := method(
        usageCount := usageCount + 1
        lastModified := Date now
        markChanged  // Persistence covenant
        self
    )
)

// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Class-based thinking
ConceptClass := Object clone do(
    new := method(  // Mimics 'new' constructor
        self clone
    )
)
```

### Persistence Covenant
Every state-modifying method must end with `markChanged()` to trigger ZODB transaction:
```io
addRelationship := method(relationType, targetOid,
    // ... modify state ...
    markChanged  // Fulfills persistence contract
    self
)
```

### Shared Memory Semantics
- **Zero-copy IPC**: Large data (tensors, hypervectors) transferred via shared memory blocks
- **Handle Management**: `SharedMemoryHandle` structs with name, offset, size, data pointer
- **JSON Tasks**: Small control messages via JSON serialization over shared memory

### Canonical Directory Structure
```
libs/Telos/
├── source/          # C substrate (synaptic_bridge.h ABI)
├── io/             # Io prototypes (Concept.io, TelosBridge.io)
├── python/         # Python workers (process pool, handlers)
└── tests/          # Io-orchestrated test harnesses
```

## INTEGRATION POINTS AND PATTERNS

### Synaptic Bridge C ABI (synaptic_bridge.h)
**Contract**: Immutable C ABI for inter-language communication
- **Function Signature**: `extern "C"` declarations with standard calling conventions
- **Handle Types**: `IoObjectHandle`, `SharedMemoryHandle`, `VSAHandle` for GC safety
- **Error Propagation**: Two-call protocol (get_last_error after failed operations)

### Concept Prototype (Concept.io)

## MORPHIC UI PRINCIPLES

### Living Objects
All UI elements are prototype-based objects modifiable at runtime

### Direct Manipulation  
Users reshape and reprogram interface elements directly

### Event-Driven Architecture
Message passing between UI objects and application logic

### SDL2 Integration
Cross-platform rendering with hardware acceleration support

## ZODB PERSISTENCE PATTERNS

### Transactional Integrity
All state changes occur within ACID transactions

### Persistence Covenant
Every state-modifying method calls `markChanged()`

### Orthogonal Persistence
Objects persist automatically without explicit serialization

### Conflict Resolution
Automatic merging of concurrent modifications

## FEDERATED MEMORY ARCHITECTURE

### L3 Ground Truth (ZODB/ZEO)
Persistent object database with transactional semantics

### L2 Cache (DiskANN)
Vector similarity search for large-scale retrieval

### L1 Cache (FAISS)
Fast in-memory vector operations

### Transactional Outbox
Event-driven synchronization between cache layers

## LLM TRANSDUCTION PIPELINE

### Natural Language Transducers
LLM integration for text-to-schema, schema-to-text, tool-call generation

### Physical Integration
Synaptic bridge-based LLM service communication

### Logical Protocols
Structured message schemas for transduction operations

### Ollama Integration
Local LLM deployment with standardized interfaces

## AUTOFACILITATION PROTOCOLS

### Standing Orders
- Perfect recall of all TELOS concepts and documentation
- PID control loop maintenance at cycle start/end
- Context-aware triage for error resolution
- Io supremacy enforcement over Python operations
- Zero violations mandate across all languages

### Operational Cycles
- Start: Documentation refresh + PID update + context establishment
- Execution: Context-informed operations with evidence-based validation
- End: PID reconciliation + run_log/system_status synchronization

### Validation Requirements
- 3-way validation for all claims (build output, manual inspection, independent verification)
- Transcript evidence for all success claims
- Immediate retraction of disproven assertions
- Artifact preservation for auditability

### Error Recovery
- Context saturation detection and AutoPrompt rewriting
- External research authorization for knowledge gaps
- Timeout discipline for hanging operations
- Failure analysis for antifragile evolution

## CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

### Synaptic Bridge Status
- **PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL**: Io → C ABI loads successfully but initialization fails due to incorrect test arguments (integer vs Map)
- **Python Operations**: Functional when bridge properly initialized, but blocked by initialization failure
- **C ABI Compliance**: Pure extern "C" implementation verified, argument parsing correct for properly formatted JSON
- **Impact**: Io supremacy partially maintained; bridge functionality blocked by test argument errors

### Prototypal Linter Status
- **Functionality**: Io linting operational, Python linting functional, C linting blocked by bridge initialization failure
- **Python Operations**: Successfully executes through synaptic bridge when initialized
- **Bridge Integration**: Complete Io → C → Python pipeline validated but blocked by initialization issues
- **Architectural Compliance**: Enforcing prototypal purity across Io and Python, C blocked by bridge issues

### Development Status
- **Phase 4+ Blocked**: Functional synaptic bridge requires proper initialization to enable advanced development
- **Zero Violations Progress**: Python linting operational (9 violations detected), C linting blocked, Io linting functional
- **Io Supremacy Restored**: Python operations properly orchestrated through Io when bridge initialized
- **System Coherence**: Neuro-symbolic architecture integrity maintained but bridge initialization prevents full validation

### Immediate Action Required
- **CURRENT_FILE_STATUS**: libs/Telos/tests/test_bridge_ping.io - broken - "Argument must be a Map" error - initialize method called with integer instead of Map configuration
- **DEPENDENCY_CHAIN**: test_bridge_ping.io → Telos Bridge initialize → IoTelosBridge_initialize → synaptic_bridge.c bridge_initialize → Python worker initialization
- **ACTIVE_DEBUG_SESSION**: test_bridge_ping.io - Io initialize method expects Map but receives integer - need to fix test to pass proper Map configuration
- **CONTEXT_SATURATION_CHECK**: test_bridge_ping.io - context window normal - external research not needed - Io documentation refresh required for proper Map usage
- **VALIDATION_REQUIREMENTS**: test_bridge_ping.io - success criteria: initialize method accepts Map and returns success - 3-way validation: Io error elimination, bridge status success, Python worker availability
- **RESOLUTION_PATHWAY**: test_bridge_ping.io - attempted fixes: identified integer vs Map mismatch - partial successes: bridge loads successfully - remaining blockers: proper Map configuration in test
- **SYSTEM_IMPACT_ASSESSMENT**: test_bridge_ping.io - components affected: bridge initialization, C linting, Python operations - Phase blocking status: blocks ZERO violations target - Io supremacy impact: prevents full synaptic bridge validation
- **ANTIFRAGILE_LEARNING**: test_bridge_ping.io - lessons learned: Io initialize method requires Map object, not primitive types - system strengthening opportunities: improve error messages for argument type validation

### Next Operational Cycle Objectives
- Fix test_bridge_ping.io to pass Map configuration to initialize method for proper bridge initialization
- Resolve bridge initialization failure to enable C linting functionality
- Re-run validation gauntlet with properly initialized bridge to achieve ZERO violations target
- Enable Phase 4+ development with fully functional neuro-symbolic architecture
