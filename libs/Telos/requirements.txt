# --- Deferred Canonical Dependencies (Blueprint Alignment) ---------------
# The following are documented in the implementation blueprint but intentionally
# deferred until their service wrappers & C bridge integration are committed.
# When enabling, un-comment with pinned versions after empirical compatibility tests.
# torch==<pin>
# torchhd==<pin>
# faiss-cpu==<pin>        # or faiss-gpu where GPU available
# diskannpy==<pin>
# sentence-transformers==<pin>
