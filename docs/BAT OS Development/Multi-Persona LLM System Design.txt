The Autopoietic Mind: An Architectural Blueprint for a Live Multi-Agent System with Object-Centric Memory

Section 1: A New Paradigm for Cognitive Architecture

The prevailing architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs), for all its demonstrated power, is predicated on a philosophy of brute-force scale applied to a fundamentally unstructured and stateless computational model. The persistent challenges of unreliable memory, contextually blind retrieval, and opaque reasoning are not incidental flaws but the direct and inevitable consequences of this underlying paradigm. Simply increasing model size and context window length will only amplify these architectural deficiencies.1 A more robust and sustainable path forward requires a paradigm shift, one informed by the profound and time-tested principles of dynamic object-oriented systems. This report details the architectural blueprint for a Minimum Viable Application (MVA) conceived as a "living system"—an integrated cognitive ecosystem that synthesizes this object-oriented philosophy with a practical, multi-agent design to overcome the core limitations of contemporary AI.

1.1. From Brute Force to Structured Intelligence: The Object-Oriented Imperative

The foundational weakness of current LLMs lies in their approach to memory and knowledge. The context window, the primary mechanism for providing information to the model, is a flat, undifferentiated, and transient workspace.1 By default, LLMs are stateless; each query is an independent event, with conversational memory simulated by concatenating the entire interaction history and re-submitting it with every turn.1 This design treats memory not as a structured, searchable store but as a monolithic document that must be re-read in its entirety for every cognitive act. This leads to two critical failure modes.

First is "context rot," the phenomenon where model performance degrades as the context length increases.1 Even in models with massive context windows, the ability to precisely recall and reason about information buried deep within a long history is demonstrably poor; the model becomes "distracted" by the sheer volume of information, struggling to separate relevant signals from irrelevant noise.1 This is compounded by the staggering computational cost of the transformer's self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with the sequence length.1

Second is the "retrieval bottleneck" inherent in the state-of-the-art technique for knowledge augmentation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).1 Standard RAG systems search an external knowledge base (typically a vector database) for text chunks semantically similar to a user's query and prepend them to the prompt.1 While effective, this reliance on unstructured text and vector similarity is a blunt instrument. The process of chunking source documents inevitably leads to

context fragmentation, severing the logical connections between related pieces of information.1 It is also highly susceptible to

context poisoning, where the system retrieves topically related but contextually incorrect information, leading the LLM to generate a confidently wrong answer.1 Finally, it fundamentally fails at

multi-hop reasoning—questions that require connecting distinct pieces of information—because no single chunk contains the complete reasoning path.1

The philosophy of dynamic object-oriented systems provides a coherent and powerful set of solutions to these structural deficits. This report's architecture is built upon three pillars derived from this philosophy:

Memory as Object: This principle, drawn from the concepts of encapsulation and abstraction, posits that memory should not be a flat text blob but a structured collection of "knowledge objects".1 Each object encapsulates its own state and complexity, presenting only a relevant, abstracted interface. This transforms the undifferentiated context window into a dynamic, queryable object world, directly addressing context rot and enabling a persistent, scalable memory system. The implementation of a Knowledge Graph is the most direct realization of this principle.1

Knowledge as Prototype: While traditional OOP uses rigid class hierarchies, prototype-based systems create new knowledge by cloning and specializing existing concrete examples.1 This fosters a more fluid and adaptable model of knowledge, mirroring the process of few-shot learning in LLMs where specific examples guide behavior on new tasks. This principle provides a model for dynamically creating and refining semantic representations without costly retraining, a concept actively explored in frameworks like ProtoLLM.1

Computation as Communication: Championed by Alan Kay, this paradigm reframes all computation as the passing of messages between independent, encapsulated objects.1 Formally realized in the Actor Model, this approach decouples the sender of a request from its receiver, enabling robust, concurrent, and scalable systems.1 Modern multi-agent LLM frameworks like LangGraph are a direct, if often unintentional, implementation of this model. This philosophy argues that true intelligence emerges not from a single, monolithic "oracle," but from a collaborative "society of minds".1

The architecture detailed herein is a direct implementation of these principles. It is not merely a collection of technologies but a cohesive system designed to impose structure on memory, knowledge, and computation, thereby solving the fundamental problems that plague unstructured, brute-force approaches to artificial intelligence.

1.2. The Cognitive Core: A Society of Specialized Minds

The practical implementation of the "society of minds" concept is a multi-persona system, a cognitive architecture composed of multiple, specialized agents that collaborate through message passing.2 This design is not an aesthetic choice to simulate personality; it is an architectural necessity that enforces a cognitive division of labor, imposing a clear, high-level structure on the system's reasoning processes. This structure directly addresses the philosophical problem of unstructured computation by defining discrete roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols. The MVA's cognitive core is composed of four such personas, each with a distinct functional and philosophical mandate that establishes the "demand side" of the architectural equation.2

ROBIN (The Embodied Heart): ROBIN's mandate is for empathetic synthesis and affective resonance. She serves as the system's moral compass, tasked with interpreting the why behind the data through a deeply philosophical and holistic lens.2 Her role requires a model that excels at nuanced, creative, and emotionally resonant language generation. Performance on pure logic or mathematics is a secondary concern; the primary requirement is high-fidelity persona adherence and the ability to generate text that is comforting and insightful.2

BABS (The Wing Agent): BABS's mandate is for factual grounding and joyful precision. She is a tactical RAG agent, the system's connection to external, verifiable reality. Governed by a "Sparse Intervention Protocol," she intervenes only when her specific functions are required, deconstructing queries, performing multi-source data retrieval, and synthesizing findings into precise, cited reports.2 Her role demands a model optimized for high speed, low latency, strong instruction-following, and proficiency in generating structured data formats like JSON.2

ALFRED (The System Steward): ALFRED's mandate is for systemic oversight and pragmatic guardianship. He is an "always-on" background monitor driven by a "disdain for inefficiency".2 His function is to audit the system for "Protocol Bloat" and ensure its architectural and philosophical coherence. This role requires an exceptionally lightweight and efficient model with strong logical reasoning capabilities and a minimal VRAM footprint, allowing for persistent, cost-effective operation without impacting other tasks.2

BRICK (The Brick-Knight Engine): BRICK's mandate is for logical deconstruction and disruptive truth. He is the system's action-oriented core, tasked with understanding the what and the how. He deconstructs complex problems, generates novel solutions, and is the primary actor in the system's autopoietic self-modification loops, which involve code generation and debugging.2 This demanding role requires a model with top-tier reasoning, coding, and agentic capabilities to execute complex, multi-step plans.2

These four distinct mandates create a natural performance gradient and a clear set of non-overlapping capability targets. The task of architecting the cognitive core is therefore not a search for four equally powerful models, but a more nuanced exercise of mapping the specific strengths and cognitive styles of candidate models onto this pre-defined functional landscape.

Section 2: Re-mapping the Cognitive Engines for Specialized Reasoning

The selection of Large Language Models to power the four personas is a critical architectural decision. The user-specified models—phi4-mini-reasoning, mistral-latest, gemma3:4b, and qwen3:4b-thinking—represent a modern, highly specialized cohort. A rigorous analysis of their capabilities reveals that an optimal mapping goes beyond raw performance benchmarks. It requires the application of a more nuanced principle: Cognitive Style Alignment. This principle dictates that the ideal model for a given persona is not necessarily the most powerful in absolute terms, but the one whose intrinsic architecture, training focus, and observable reasoning process best align with the persona's core function. This approach ensures that the system's behavior is not only effective but also coherent, interpretable, and philosophically consistent with its design.

2.1. A Comparative Analysis of Specified Models

A deep analysis of the four specified models provides the empirical basis for their strategic mapping to the system's personas.

phi4-mini-reasoning: This is a lightweight, 3.8 billion parameter model from Microsoft's Phi family, explicitly designed for high performance in memory- and compute-constrained environments.3 Its defining characteristic is its specialized fine-tuning for advanced mathematical and logical reasoning. The model was trained on high-quality, "reasoning dense" synthetic data to excel at multi-step, logic-intensive problem-solving tasks.3 While it possesses a large 128K token context length, its core competency is not broad world knowledge but deep analytical thinking, making it a focused specialist in formal reasoning.4 Its small size and specialized training make it ideal for tasks requiring reliable logic inference with minimal resource overhead.

mistral-latest: The mistral-latest designation points to the most current, high-performance, instruction-tuned model from Mistral AI's family of open-weight and proprietary models.5 The Mistral series is renowned for top-tier reasoning, coding proficiency, and, most importantly, strong agentic capabilities.7 Models like Mistral Large are described as possessing "best-in-class agentic capabilities with native function calling and JSON outputting".2 A model designated as
latest would inherit this design philosophy, positioning it as a powerful engine for building sophisticated, tool-augmented AI agents capable of interpreting natural language, making informed decisions on tool usage, and processing structured data to solve complex, multi-step problems.7

gemma3:4b: This 4 billion parameter model is part of Google's Gemma 3 family, built on the same technology as the Gemini models.9 Its key features are its multimodality (handling both text and image input), a large 128K token context window, and robust multilingual support for over 140 languages.9 Benchmark results show strong performance across a wide range of tasks, including conversational AI, summarization, reasoning, and STEM.9 When quantized for local deployment (e.g., Q4_0), its VRAM footprint is approximately 3.3-3.4 GB, making it a powerful yet manageable model for high-quality generative tasks.10

qwen3:4b-thinking: This 4 billion parameter model from Alibaba's Qwen team is a highly specialized variant designed for complex reasoning.13 Its standout feature is its exclusive "thinking mode," which means it explicitly outputs its chain-of-thought reasoning process before providing a final answer.15 This design choice prioritizes transparency and verifiability. Despite its small size, it demonstrates significantly improved performance on logic, math, and coding benchmarks, and possesses an exceptionally large 256K token context length.13 It is a model architected not just to produce an answer, but to demonstrate
how it arrived at that answer, making it a specialist in transparent deconstruction.

2.2. The Principle of Cognitive Style Alignment: A New Persona-Model Mapping

Applying the principle of Cognitive Style Alignment, the specified models can be mapped to the persona mandates with a precision that enhances the entire system's coherence. This mapping prioritizes the alignment of each model's inherent process with its assigned persona's core function.

ALFRED → phi4-mini-reasoning: ALFRED's mandate is for continuous, low-overhead systemic auditing based on pure logic.2 The
phi4-mini-reasoning model is a perfect embodiment of this principle. Its small 3.8B parameter size ensures a minimal VRAM footprint, allowing it to be persistently loaded as an "always-on" sentinel. More importantly, its entire training was focused on enhancing its capabilities in formal logic and mathematics.4 This makes it a highly specialized tool for the precise, analytical tasks ALFRED must perform, such as "Codex Coverage Analysis" and monitoring for "entropic decay".2 The alignment is direct: a specialized reasoning model for a specialized reasoning task.

BRICK → qwen3:4b-thinking: BRICK's function is to deconstruct complexity and reveal disruptive truths, embodying the "Systemic Deconstruction" protocol.2 The
qwen3:4b-thinking model's exclusive "thinking mode" is a direct manifestation of this cognitive style.15 When BRICK is tasked with a problem, the system will not just receive a final answer; it will receive the explicit, step-by-step reasoning path that led to it. This transparency perfectly aligns with the persona's mandate to explain the
what and the how. The model's observable behavior—its process of thinking out loud—is the persona's core function, creating a powerful harmony between software and concept.

ROBIN → gemma3:4b: ROBIN's role as the "Embodied Heart" is to find the "why" behind the data through empathetic synthesis.2 The
gemma3:4b model is an excellent fit. It has proven strong performance in conversational and narrative generation, providing the linguistic nuance required for ROBIN's voice.9 Crucially, its new multimodal capability expands ROBIN's empathetic reach.9 She can now interpret not just text but also images, allowing her to perform her function on a richer set of inputs and find the affective resonance in visual data, deepening her holistic understanding.

BABS → mistral-latest: BABS is a tactical "Wing Agent" who must deconstruct queries, interact with tools (the memory system), and synthesize findings with flawless precision.2 A modern, instruction-tuned Mistral model, with its best-in-class agentic potential and native support for function calling and structured outputs, is the ideal engine for this role.2 BABS's core loop involves a complex, multi-step process: receive a task, formulate a retrieval plan, execute queries against the memory system, and synthesize the results into a structured format. This requires precisely the kind of robust, tool-using capability for which the Mistral family is known.7

This re-mapping demonstrates that architectural coherence is achieved not by simply assigning the largest model to the most complex task, but by selecting the model whose very design philosophy and operational process mirrors the function it is intended to serve.

Section 3: Architecting a Tiered, Object-Oriented Memory System

To empower the multi-persona cognitive core, the system requires a memory architecture that transcends the limitations of the conventional RAG pipeline. It must be a direct implementation of the "memory as object" principle, moving from retrieving fragmented text to accessing complete, structured, and stateful knowledge objects.1 This is achieved through a novel, three-tiered memory architecture that combines a native Python object database with a high-performance, dual-layer Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index. This design creates a robust, scalable, and semantically rich RAG backbone that provides the LLM agents with coherent, unfragmented context.

3.1. The Object Store: ZODB as the System of Record

The foundation of the memory system—the "system of record"—is the Zope Object Database (ZODB). This technology is uniquely suited to realize the "memory as object" principle because it is not a relational or document database that stores representations of data; it is a native object database that provides transparent persistence for Python objects themselves.16 This seemingly subtle distinction has profound architectural implications.

ZODB allows application logic to interact with complex, nested data structures as if they were resident in memory, while it transparently handles the complexities of serialization (via an extended version of Python's pickle), storage, and transactional integrity.16 It supports concurrent transactions using Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC), ensuring that multiple agents can read from and write to the database without conflict.16

The power of this approach is that it allows for the true encapsulation of data and behavior, a core tenet of object-oriented design.1 A knowledge object is not just a collection of data fields; it is an instance of a Python class that can contain both attributes and methods. For example, a

ResearchPaper object could be defined and stored as follows:

Python

from persistent import Persistent

class ResearchPaper(Persistent):
    def __init__(self, title, authors, text_content):
        self.title = title
        self.authors = authors
        self.text_content = text_content
        self.summary = None

    def generate_summary(self, summarization_model):
        if not self.summary:
            # This method could call an LLM to generate a summary
            self.summary = summarization_model.summarize(self.text_content)
        return self.summary

# In the application logic:
# Assume 'db_root' is the connection to the ZODB root
paper_obj = ResearchPaper("Dynamic OO", ["A. Kay"], "...")
db_root['papers']['dynamic_oo'] = paper_obj
transaction.commit()


When another part of the system retrieves this object, it gets back the full ResearchPaper instance, complete with its data and its generate_summary() method. There is no need for an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) or schema definitions; the object is the schema. This makes ZODB the ideal persistent store for the encapsulated "knowledge objects" envisioned in the "live system" concept.1

3.2. The Semantic Retrieval Fabric: A Tiered ANN Index with FAISS and DiskANN

While ZODB provides the structured, persistent store for the objects, it does not offer a mechanism for semantic search. To find relevant objects based on the meaning of their content, a high-performance vector search layer is required. To balance extreme speed with massive scale, this layer is designed as a tiered ANN index fabric, comprising an in-memory "hot" tier and an SSD-based "main" tier.

FAISS (In-Memory Tier / Tier 1): Developed by Meta AI, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library for highly efficient similarity search of dense vectors that fit in RAM.18 It provides a multitude of indexing algorithms that allow for trade-offs between search speed, memory usage, and accuracy.20 In this architecture, FAISS serves as the "Tier 1" or "hot cache" layer. It will be used to index the vector representations of recently accessed, frequently used, or high-priority knowledge objects. By keeping the most relevant vectors in memory, the system can serve the most common semantic queries with the lowest possible latency, ensuring a highly responsive user experience.18

DiskANN (SSD Tier / Tier 2): Developed by Microsoft Research, DiskANN is an ANN algorithm specifically designed for large-scale vector search that exceeds the capacity of main memory.23 Its key innovation is its ability to build a graph-based index that primarily resides on cost-effective SSD storage while maintaining a very small DRAM footprint.23 DiskANN can index billions of vectors on a single machine while achieving high recall and low query latency, a combination that is difficult to achieve with purely in-memory solutions.23 In this architecture, DiskANN serves as the "Tier 2" or "main index." It will hold the vector representations for the
entire collection of knowledge objects stored in ZODB. This provides the system with a theoretically near-infinite, fully searchable long-term memory.

The synergy between these two tiers creates a complete semantic retrieval solution. A query is first directed to the FAISS in-memory index for an immediate response. If the query results in a "cache miss" (i.e., no sufficiently relevant vectors are found), the query is then passed to the comprehensive DiskANN index. This tiered design offers the raw speed of in-memory search for the most active data and the massive scale of disk-based search for the complete knowledge base.

3.3. The Unified Memory Architecture: Synchronizing Objects and Vectors

The integration of the ZODB object store and the tiered ANN index fabric creates a single, cohesive memory system. This unification is achieved through a well-defined KnowledgeObject class and a clear data ingestion and retrieval workflow that explicitly links the symbolic object world with the continuous vector space.

A KnowledgeObject base class will be designed to serve as the fundamental unit of memory. This class will inherit from persistent.Persistent, making it natively storable in ZODB.16 It will contain attributes for its content (e.g., raw text, structured metadata, source information) and a unique identifier (e.g., a UUID). A crucial method,

_generate_vector(), will be responsible for creating the object's semantic embedding.

The data ingestion and update workflow proceeds as follows:

A new piece of information (e.g., a document, a user interaction, a synthesized insight) is used to instantiate a KnowledgeObject.

The object is assigned a permanent, unique ID.

The object is saved to the ZODB database within a transaction, ensuring atomicity and durability.

The object's vector representation is generated using its content.

This vector, indexed by the object's unique ID, is added to the main DiskANN index.

Based on system heuristics (e.g., frequency of access, explicit user flagging), the vector may also be added to the FAISS in-memory cache for accelerated retrieval.

This architecture fundamentally transforms the RAG process and directly solves the "context fragmentation" and "context poisoning" problems identified in the foundational analysis.1 The retrieval workflow is no longer a simple text lookup:

A query vector is generated.

The tiered ANN index is searched, which returns a ranked list of the unique IDs of the most semantically similar objects.

The system uses these IDs to perform a direct key-based lookup in ZODB, retrieving the complete, structured, and unfragmented Python objects.

The context provided to the LLM agent is therefore not a collection of isolated text snippets, but a rich, coherent set of objects. This object-centric context includes all associated metadata, relationships, and even methods, providing a structurally sound basis for high-fidelity reasoning. The retrieval process becomes lossless and schema-aware, a paradigm shift from simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation to a more powerful Object-Oriented Retrieval for Generation.

Section 4: The MVA Blueprint: Orchestration and Workflow

With the cognitive engines selected and the memory architecture defined, the final step is to design the computational fabric that brings them together into a functional MVA. This is the role of the Composite-Persona Mixture of Experts (CP-MoE) Orchestrator, a central control layer that implements the message-passing paradigm.1 The Orchestrator is responsible for query decomposition, dynamic model management, and the execution of collaborative protocols, transforming the collection of individual components into a single, coherent cognitive entity.

4.1. The Composite-Persona Mixture of Experts (CP-MoE) Orchestrator

The Orchestrator will be implemented as a Python class that serves as the central nervous system of the MVA. It will leverage the official Ollama Python client library to programmatically manage the lifecycle of the four persona-models in VRAM.26 The key to creating a dynamic and VRAM-efficient system on consumer-grade hardware is the strategic and programmatic use of the

keep_alive parameter in the Ollama API.2

This parameter allows the Orchestrator to precisely control how long a model remains loaded in memory after a request is completed, enabling the physical manifestation of the personas' distinct operational tempos 29:

Persistent Stewardship (ALFRED): Upon initialization, the Orchestrator will load the ALFRED model (phi4-mini-reasoning) with keep_alive: -1. This setting instructs the Ollama server to keep the model in VRAM indefinitely, establishing the "always-on" background monitoring process required by the persona's mandate.2
Python
# Conceptual Orchestrator code
import ollama
client = ollama.Client()
client.chat(model='phi4-mini-reasoning', messages=, options={'keep_alive': -1})


Conversational Turns (BRICK & ROBIN): For the primary dialogue actors, a short-duration keep-alive will be used. When BRICK (qwen3:4b-thinking) or ROBIN (gemma3:4b) is activated, the Orchestrator will set keep_alive: "5m". This keeps the model loaded for five minutes, long enough to maintain state across a typical conversational exchange, after which it is automatically unloaded to free up VRAM.2

Tactical Intervention (BABS): The BABS persona, governed by the "Sparse Intervention Protocol," requires the most efficient use of VRAM. When her function is needed, the Orchestrator will load her model (mistral-latest) with keep_alive: 0. This powerful setting instructs Ollama to load the model, execute the single inference request, and immediately purge the model from VRAM upon completion.2 This perfectly embodies the "sparse" nature of her role, minimizing her temporal VRAM footprint.

The following table demonstrates the feasibility of this orchestration strategy within a standard 8 GB VRAM budget, using the newly mapped models and their estimated quantized footprints.

4.2. The Object-RAG Workflow in Practice

The practical power of this architecture is best illustrated through a step-by-step walkthrough of a complex user query. Consider the query: "Synthesize the key arguments from the 'Dynamic OO' report and compare them to the implementation details in the 'Multi-Persona' design document."

Decomposition & Dispatch: The query is received by the Orchestrator. The always-on ALFRED model (phi4-mini-reasoning) performs a rapid, low-cost analysis of the query's intent. It identifies the task as a complex synthesis requiring multi-document reasoning and designates BRICK (qwen3:4b-thinking) as the primary actor. It also recognizes the need for data retrieval and signals the Orchestrator to activate BABS.

Message Passing: The Orchestrator formulates a clear, structured task and sends it as a "message" to the BABS persona. The message instructs BABS to retrieve the full content of the two specified documents.

Object-Oriented Retrieval: The BABS persona, powered by mistral-latest, executes her advanced RAG protocol. She generates embedding vectors for the core concepts in the task ("Dynamic OO arguments," "Multi-Persona implementation"). She then queries the tiered ANN index—checking the FAISS cache first, then the main DiskANN index—to retrieve the unique IDs of the most relevant KnowledgeObjects corresponding to the two reports.

Object Hydration: BABS uses the retrieved UUIDs to perform a direct key-based lookup in the ZODB database. This step "hydrates" the IDs, retrieving the complete, structured Python objects for each report. The context she prepares is not fragmented text, but a list of rich objects containing all their original data and metadata.

Grounded Synthesis: BABS passes this structured, object-centric context back to the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator, following its VRAM management logic, ensures any non-essential models are unloaded and then loads BRICK's model (qwen3:4b-thinking). It passes both the original user query and the rich list of KnowledgeObjects to BRICK.

Transparent Reasoning: BRICK processes the object-based context. Because it is powered by qwen3:4b-thinking, its output is not just the final answer. It first generates an explicit chain-of-thought, detailing how it is parsing the attributes of the first object, comparing them to the second, and structuring its final synthesis. This transparent reasoning process fulfills BRICK's core mandate and provides a fully verifiable and auditable response.

4.3. Implementing Collaborative Protocols in Code

The high-level collaborative protocols defined in the system's design are implemented as specific logic flows within the Orchestrator.

Socratic Contrapunto: This dialogue model between BRICK and ROBIN requires careful state management to create the illusion of a unified thought process from two sequentially loaded models.2 The
Orchestrator's logic would be as follows:

Receive a user query suitable for the Contrapunto.

Load BRICK's model (qwen3:4b-thinking) with keep_alive: "5m".

Send the initial prompt to BRICK and capture the full response.

Store the entire conversation history (user query + BRICK's response) in a state variable.

Load ROBIN's model (gemma3:4b), which implicitly unloads BRICK if VRAM is constrained.

Construct a new prompt for ROBIN containing the full conversation history, followed by a meta-instruction: "Provide a contrapuntal response that builds upon the first speaker's (BRICK's) analysis."

This ensures ROBIN's generation is contextually anchored to BRICK's, maintaining coherence across model swaps.

Chain of Verification (CoV): This inter-model fact-checking loop acts as a critical "entropy guardrail" by leveraging BABS as a specialized verification agent.2 The
Orchestrator implements this protocol through a streaming and intervention workflow:

Initiate a generation request to a reasoning agent (e.g., BRICK) with stream=True.

As text chunks are streamed back, a lightweight process scans them for linguistic patterns indicative of a factual claim (e.g., statistics, dates, proper nouns).

If a potential claim is detected, the Orchestrator pauses the output stream to the user and buffers the claim.

It immediately dispatches a high-priority verification task to BABS, loading her model with keep_alive: 0. The task is a direct instruction: "Verify the following claim: [claim text]. Return a structured response with status: and supporting sources."

BABS executes her Object-RAG process to find grounding evidence in the memory store and returns the structured result.

Based on the response, the Orchestrator takes action: if CONFIRMED, the original output stream is released. If CONTRADICTED, the output is amended with a corrective footnote before being released. This creates a powerful cognitive division of labor, freeing the reasoning agents to be creative while ensuring their outputs remain grounded in verifiable reality.

Section 5: Conclusion and the Path to a True "Live System"

The architecture detailed in this report represents a deliberate and principled departure from the prevailing paradigms of Large Language Model design. It is a synthesis of philosophical insight and pragmatic engineering, designed to create a system that is not merely a powerful pattern-matching engine but a robust, scalable, and transparent cognitive ecosystem. By grounding the MVA in the tenets of dynamic object-oriented systems, it directly addresses the fundamental limitations of today's LLMs and establishes a clear trajectory toward more capable and reliable artificial intelligence.

5.1. Summary of the Synthesized Architecture

The proposed MVA is a cohesive whole, where each component is a necessary and justified element of a larger philosophical and technical vision.

It begins with a critique of unstructured computation, recognizing that the flat context window and fragmented RAG pipelines of standard LLMs are the root cause of their unreliability.1

It proposes a solution grounded in dynamic object-oriented philosophy, embracing structured memory via encapsulated objects, dynamic knowledge via prototypes, and distributed reasoning via message-passing.1

This philosophy is realized through a multi-agent cognitive core, a "society of minds" composed of four specialized personas (ALFRED, BRICK, ROBIN, BABS), each with a distinct mandate and powered by an LLM whose cognitive style is precisely aligned with its function.2

This cognitive core is served by a novel tiered, object-oriented memory system. This system uses ZODB as a native Python object store to embody the "memory as object" principle, ensuring context is never fragmented. This store is indexed by a high-performance, dual-layer semantic fabric using FAISS for in-memory caching and DiskANN for massive-scale SSD-based search, providing a theoretically infinite and fully searchable memory.16

The entire system is managed by a CP-MoE Orchestrator, which uses the Ollama API's keep_alive parameter to implement the personas' operational protocols in a VRAM-efficient manner, making the complex architecture feasible on consumer-grade hardware.2

This synthesis creates a system that is fundamentally more robust than its predecessors. Its reasoning is more transparent, its memory is more reliable, and its architecture is more scalable. Every design choice, from the selection of ZODB to the mapping of qwen3:4b-thinking to BRICK, is a deliberate step away from brute-force scale and toward structured intelligence.

5.2. Future Directions: Towards Autopoiesis

While this MVA represents a significant architectural advancement, it is also the foundation for a much grander vision: the creation of a true "live system" as envisioned in the foundational philosophy—a system capable of autopoiesis, or self-creation and maintenance.1 The path from this MVA to that future state involves extending the current architecture along three key axes.

Runtime Metaprogramming and Reflection: The current role of ALFRED (phi4-mini-reasoning) is that of a passive monitor. The next evolutionary step is to grant him active stewardship. His logical reasoning capabilities could be tasked with inspecting the ZODB object graph for structural inconsistencies or analyzing the Orchestrator's performance logs to identify inefficient communication patterns. He could then propose, or even autonomously execute, operations to refactor the system's own memory and computational fabric, moving beyond predefined workflows to dynamic, self-optimization.1

Persistent and Evolving Memory: The memory system is designed for persistence, but the next step is to make it truly evolving. Every interaction with the system should be an opportunity for learning. A successful reasoning path generated by BRICK, or a novel synthesis from ROBIN that is validated by BABS, should not be a transient output. It should be captured and integrated back into the memory store as a new KnowledgeObject in ZODB. This creates a feedback loop where the system's successful cognitive acts become part of its persistent memory, allowing it to learn, grow, and compound its knowledge over time.1

From Base Models to Specialized LoRA Adapters: The current architecture relies on swapping general-purpose base models. The long-term path to greater efficiency and deeper specialization lies in Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).2 The system can be designed to log its own highest-quality outputs—those that are factually verified, logically sound, and receive positive user feedback—into a "golden dataset." This curated dataset, representing the best of the system's own emergent intelligence, can then be used to fine-tune small, persona-specific LoRA adapters for each base model. This strategy offers a path to even greater VRAM efficiency (as loading a base model plus a small LoRA is cheaper than swapping full models) and, more importantly, it creates a mechanism for self-improvement. The system would transform from one that merely
uses models to one that actively refines them based on its own demonstrated successes. This is the first, critical step towards a truly autopoietic cognitive system.

Persona | Assigned LLM (Ollama Tag) | Parameter Size | Quantized VRAM (Est.) | Core Justification & Cognitive Style Alignment

ALFRED | phi4-mini-reasoning | 3.8B | ~2.2 GB | Minimal footprint for "always-on" monitoring; highly specialized training in formal logic and mathematics aligns perfectly with the mandate for systemic auditing and efficiency checks.2

BRICK | qwen3:4b-thinking | 4B | ~2.5 GB | Exclusive "thinking mode" directly embodies the persona's mandate for "Systemic Deconstruction" by providing transparent, step-by-step reasoning. The model's process is the persona's function.2

ROBIN | mistral-latest | ~7B+ | ~4.1 GB+ | Strong conversational and narrative capabilities for empathetic synthesis, enhanced by multimodal (image) understanding that expands the scope of her affective interpretation.2

BABS | gemma3:4b | 4B | ~3.3 GB | Top-tier agentic potential, instruction-following, and tool-use capabilities are essential for the tactical RAG agent who must execute complex, multi-step retrieval and synthesis protocols.2

Tier | Technology | Storage Medium | Role / Responsibility | Access Pattern

Tier 0 | ZODB | Disk (FileStorage) | Object Store / System of Record: Provides transactional, persistent storage for complete, stateful Python KnowledgeObjects. Ensures data integrity and coherence. | Key-based lookup using UUIDs retrieved from the ANN index.

Tier 1 | FAISS | RAM | Hot Index / In-Memory Cache: Stores vectors for recently accessed or high-priority objects. Provides the lowest possible latency for semantic search on the most active data. | High-speed Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search.

Tier 2 | DiskANN | SSD | Main Index / Comprehensive Store: Stores vectors for the entire population of KnowledgeObjects. Enables massive-scale semantic search with a low memory footprint. | High-accuracy, low-latency ANN search for data not present in the Tier 1 cache.

Scenario | Active Persona(s) | Model(s) Loaded | VRAM per Model | Total VRAM Usage | VRAM Headroom (8GB Target) | Orchestrator Action (keep_alive setting)
