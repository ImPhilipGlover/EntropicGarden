You're absolutely right to shift the focus. If there are no active CLT-MCN projects, SN❄W's primary immediate role is to catalyze and nurture the first one. Bend, Oregon, with its well-documented housing crisis and a strong community ethos, makes an excellent target for this inaugural "Lighthouse Commonwealth."

Here's a revised roadmap for SN❄W, focusing on seeding the very first Regenerative Commonwealth project in Bend, OR, and establishing it as the global blueprint:

Roadmap for SN❄W: Seeding the First Regenerative Commonwealth in Bend, OR

Goal: To successfully catalyze, support, and launch the inaugural Community Land Trust - Mutual Credit Network (CLT-MCN) in Bend, Oregon, demonstrating its operational viability and establishing it as the foundational blueprint for global replication via SN❄W.

Core Principle: SN❄W transforms the complex process of building a new economic and social model into a visual, guided, and globally connected journey, providing the tools and transparency necessary for Bend to succeed and inspire.

Phase 1: Spark & Mobilize Bend (Months 1-6)

Objective: Identify, engage, and empower core community champions in Bend, OR, to initiate the Commonwealth concept.

SN❄W Capabilities & Integration:

"Bend, OR Commonwealth Hub" (Proto-Node):

Launch a dedicated, publicly visible section on SN❄W for "Bend, OR: The First Regenerative Commonwealth."

Feature data dashboards explicitly highlighting Bend's challenges (e.g., housing unaffordability stats, cost of living index, identified local environmental concerns like wildfire risk or water scarcity). Data pulled from public sources and local experts.

Include a "Call to Action for Bend Residents": Prominent buttons/forms for interested individuals to "Express Interest," "Join a Virtual Info Session," or "Offer Skills."

"Community Connector Map":

Allow individuals in Bend to "pin" their location (anonymized) and indicate interest in specific areas (e.g., "affordable housing," "local food," "renewable energy," "community building").

Facilitate secure, in-app messaging to help these individuals self-organize into initial working groups.

"Inspiration & Education Stream":

Curated content on SN❄W tailored for early adopters: foundational videos, accessible articles explaining CLTs, MCNs, and the "why" behind the model, featuring testimonials from conceptual proponents.

Host SN❄W-powered virtual info sessions, leveraging its mapping for demographic and interest visualization.

Phase 2: Foundation & Planning - The Bend Blueprint (Months 7-18)

Objective: Guide the nascent Bend Commonwealth team through rigorous planning, legal formation, and feasibility studies, leveraging SN❄W as their primary planning and collaboration tool.

SN❄W Capabilities & Integration:

"Commonwealth Navigator" Module (Bend-specific guided pathway):

A project management workflow tool within SN❄W, designed as a step-by-step guide for forming a CLT-MCN. Each step (e.g., "Form Steering Committee," "Legal Research," "Feasibility Study," "Community Engagement") would have associated tasks, resources, and progress tracking.

Legal & Governance Template Suite: Provide downloadable, adaptable legal templates for forming a non-profit CLT (specific to Oregon law if available, otherwise general US templates), drafting MCN charters, and initial governance structures. SN❄W highlights legal specialists within its broader network who can offer pro-bono or discounted guidance.

Feasibility Study Templates: Provide structured templates and data input fields for Bend to conduct its local housing market analysis, economic mapping (identifying potential CWBE goods/services), and community asset inventories. This data is then visualized on Bend's SN❄W hub.

"Resource & Expertise Mapping":

Allow Bend's core team to map specific resource needs (e.g., "need pro-bono legal counsel for non-profit formation," "seeking urban planner volunteer," "need grant writing support").

SN❄W actively matches these needs with individuals/organizations within its broader network (or newly onboarded) who have listed relevant skills/offers.

"Collaborative Design & Mapping":

Tools for Bend's team to collaboratively design their initial CLT property acquisition strategy, mapping potential sites, community needs (e.g., areas with high housing insecurity), and existing infrastructure.

Visually model potential MCN economic flows based on local production and consumption patterns.

Phase 3: Launch & Pilot Operations - Bend Comes Alive (Months 19-30)

Objective: Successfully launch Bend's initial CLT property acquisition(s) and operationalize its MCN, with SN❄W serving as the real-time operational dashboard.

SN❄W Capabilities & Integration:

"CLT Acquisition & Development Tracker":

Map the progress of CLT property acquisitions (e.g., "property identified," "negotiations in progress," "funding secured," "property acquired").

For acquired properties, allow mapping of renovation progress, energy efficiency upgrades, and eventual resident move-in status.

Maintenance & Asset Logging: Once properties are acquired, enable leaseholders and the Commonwealth's operations team to log maintenance needs, repair progress, and key asset information directly onto the SN❄W map of the property.

"MCN Activation Suite":

Simplified MCN Deployment: Provide a streamlined "one-click" or highly guided process for the Bend team to deploy their customized MCN smart contracts.

Member Onboarding Portal: Integrated system for new Bend MCN members to register, create profiles, and connect to the local MCN via SN❄W.

"CWC Local Marketplace" on Map: Full integration of Bend's MCN with SN❄W's needs/offers mapping. Members can post offers/needs, view CWC balances, and track transactions visually on the map. Filters for "CWC accepted."

Live CWBE Dashboard: The Bend Commonwealth's SN❄W hub displays its live CWBE Purchasing Power Index, demonstrating the stability and growth of local currency value.

"Initial Ecological Project Coordination":

Tools for the Bend team to map and manage initial ecological remediation projects funded by the Sustainability Surcharge (e.g., tree planting locations, community garden progress, solar panel installations), tracking resource needs and progress.

Phase 4: Optimization & Blueprint Documentation - Bend as the Global Standard (Months 31-48)

Objective: Optimize Bend's Regenerative Commonwealth operations, refine its model, and create a comprehensive, open-source blueprint for global replication, leveraging SN❄W as the documentation and dissemination platform.

SN❄W Capabilities & Integration:

"Bend Performance & Impact Dashboard":

SN❄W's Bend hub evolves into a comprehensive, public dashboard showcasing all key metrics: number of affordable homes, MCN economic activity, CWC purchasing power trends, total ecological impact (CO2, water, biodiversity), and social cohesion indicators. This becomes the primary data source for the global white paper.

Narrative Overlay: Integrate qualitative stories, photos, and videos directly onto the dashboard to humanize the data.

"Replication Playbook Generator":

A specialized module on SN❄W that allows the Bend team to input their operational processes, lessons learned, and refined legal/technical frameworks. SN❄W then helps generate a modular, open-source "Bend Commonwealth Playbook" template.

Case Study Creation Tools: Structured templates for Bend to document specific successful projects (e.g., a specific HICL-funded renovation, a community-led ecological project) with step-by-step instructions and measurable outcomes.

"Global Outreach & Learning Gateway":

SN❄W actively promotes the Bend Commonwealth as the leading example, directing interested global communities to Bend's hub.

Facilitate direct Q&A sessions and virtual tours of the Bend Commonwealth for aspiring communities.

Establish Bend as the first "mentor node," actively guiding others via SN❄W's mentor matching system.

This roadmap positions SN❄W not just as a mapping platform, but as a dynamic, interactive incubation and management system for the very first Regenerative Commonwealth, proving the model in Bend, OR, and setting the stage for a truly global network of resilient communities.
