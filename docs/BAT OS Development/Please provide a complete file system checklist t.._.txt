Of course. To ensure the successful development of the A4PS-OS, a well-defined and traceable project structure is paramount. This document provides a complete file system checklist for the Minimally Viable Entropic OS, followed by a traceability matrix that maps each component back to the specific requirements outlined in the User Requirements Specification (URS), Functional Requirements Specification (FRS), and Detailed Design Specification (DDS).

This structure is designed to be modular, testable, and directly reflective of the system's core philosophical and technical architecture.
