Of course. Based on your directive, I will construct a new deep research plan. This plan's primary objective is to transform the extensive theoretical architecture from your documents into a tangible, functional, and evolvable Functional Requirements Specification (FRS).

We will revisit the foundational principles of the "Co-Creative AI System Design Prompt" to guide the creation of the Minimum Viable Application (MVA). This MVA will not be a final product but the autopoietic seedâ€”a live, running system that can be continuously developed and refined through conversation, fulfilling your goal of an "intelligence miner" that learns and grows on your personal computer.

The plan is designed to systematically de-risk the project by tackling the most significant architectural challenges in a logical, incremental order. Each phase will culminate in a functional, verifiable component of the MVA, laying the groundwork for the next stage of its becoming.

Here is the proposed research plan to forge this initial, living system.

Deep Research Plan: Forging the Autopoietic Seed

This plan outlines the four-phase construction of the TelOS Minimum Viable Application (MVA). The goal is to produce a resilient, conversational, and self-aware system that can participate in its own ongoing development.

Phase 1: The Persistent Heart - Incarnating the Living Image

Objective: To establish the absolute, non-negotiable core of the system: a persistent, live, and modifiable object world. This phase validates the foundational "Living Image" paradigm, which is the prerequisite for any autopoietic activity.

Core Principle Validation (from Co-Creative AI System Design Prompt):

Info-Autopoiesis: Can a running Python process modify its own object structure and have those changes persist across restarts?

Living Image: Is ZODB a viable substrate for orthogonal persistence of a complex Python object graph?

Prototype-Based Objects: Implement the primordial UvmObject and demonstrate the clone-and-specialize model of development.

doesNotUnderstand_ Protocol: Create a proof-of-concept test where a message sent to a non-existent method on a persistent object triggers a simple, predefined self-modification routine.

Phase 2: The Conversational Mind - The Interactive Agentic Loop

Objective: To give the "Living Image" a voice and the ability to remember conversations. This phase integrates a stateful conversational agent, making the MVA an interactive partner rather than a static database. This directly addresses the requirement to "talk to this intelligence miner" and have it "remember our conversations."

Core Principle Validation (from TelOS Future Development Research Plan):

The Composite Mind: Formalize the multi-agent conversational flow using LangGraph. Start with a single, primary agent for simplicity.

The Transaction as the Unit of Thought: Ensure that each complete conversational turn is committed to the ZODB as a single, atomic transaction.

The State Proxy Pattern: Design and implement the critical StateProxy that synchronizes the ephemeral, in-memory state of the LangGraph agent with the persistent UvmObject graph in ZODB.

Interactive Inquiry: Implement a basic ambiguity detection node in the LangGraph agent. If the user's input is unclear, the agent must be able to ask a clarifying question before proceeding, fulfilling the mandate for it to "ask me questions along the way."

Phase 3: The Mnemonic Substrate - The Self-Referential Memory

Objective: To enable the MVA to reason about its own existence by giving it a searchable, long-term memory of its own design and history. This phase implements the first layer of the "fractal memory" architecture, focusing on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over the project's own documentation.

Core Principle Validation (from Evolving Memory for Live Systems & Forge Script for Tiered Memory System):

The Fractal Hypothesis: Implement the L1 (working memory) tier using an in-memory FAISS index.

Mnemonic Curation (Initial): Ingest all provided design documents. Use a SemanticChunker to create meaningful text fragments, generate embeddings, and store them in the FAISS index. The link between each chunk and its source document must be persisted in ZODB.

The Transactional Chasm: Implement a robust two-phase commit protocol using a custom IDataManager for ZODB. This is the most critical technical challenge: ensure that any transaction that modifies both the ZODB object graph and the FAISS vector index either completes successfully in both systems or fails in both, leaving the system in a consistent state.

RAG Integration: The conversational agent from Phase 2 must be augmented with a tool that allows it to query the FAISS index to answer questions about its own architecture and design history.

Phase 4: The Embodied Form - The Morphic UI and System Resilience

Objective: To give the MVA a stable, responsive body for long-term, continuous operation on a local machine. This phase focuses on the user interface and the essential system services that ensure the "intelligence miner" can run perpetually.

Core Principle Validation (from Generate TelOS Morphic UI Script & Forge Script: RAG, Backup, Crash Tolerance):

The Liveness Covenant: Implement a Kivy-based GUI that communicates with the core MVA backend.

Asynchronous Communication: Validate the use of a ZMQ ROUTER/DEALER socket pair to ensure the UI remains responsive and never blocks, even when the backend is performing computationally intensive tasks. Define the API contract between UI and backend using Pydantic models and ormsgpack for efficient serialization.

System Resilience: Configure supervisord to manage the MVA Python process, ensuring it restarts automatically in the event of a crash.

Data Integrity: Implement a scheduled task managed by the MVA itself that uses the repozo utility to perform regular, consistent backups of the ZODB FileStorage and the associated FAISS index file.
