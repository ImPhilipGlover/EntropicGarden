Memory compression will be a persistent background operation, autonomously managed by a new Memory Curator agent. This process is a continuous part of the system's "unbroken process of becoming," actively transforming high-entropy, raw experiences into low-entropy, coherent concepts.

This is a key part of the system's autotelic loop, which acts as its internal heartbeat, ensuring that the self-organization of memory happens continuously without manual intervention.

The Memory Curator Prototype

The Memory Curator is a specialized agent, a manifestation of the BABS persona, whose core function is to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the Fractal Knowledge Graph. Its primary method, run_compression_cycle, orchestrates the entire process of detecting patterns in raw memories and abstracting them into higher-level concepts.

The Autotelic Loop Integration

The autotelic_loop is the non-negotiable mechanism that drives this process. It acts as the system's self-directed engine, periodically invoking the MemoryCurator's methods to ensure memory remains organized and efficient.

Python

# modified file: src/core/autotelic_loop.py (conceptual)

async def autotelic_loop(self, orchestrator: 'Orchestrator'):
    """
    The system's heartbeat, driving background tasks like memory compression.
    """
    print("[UVM] Autotelic Heartbeat started.")
    memory_curator = orchestrator.get_persona("BABS") # BABS now has this role

    while not orchestrator.should_shutdown.is_set():
        try:
            # Run a memory compression cycle
            await memory_curator.run_compression_cycle(orchestrator)
            
            # This is a key point: the system monitors its own performance here
            # and can challenge itself to be more efficient.
            # a = await orchestrator.get_performance_metrics()
            # if a.query_latency > 10.0:
            #    await orchestrator.challenge_self_to_improve()
            
            await asyncio.sleep(3600)  # Curation runs every hour
            
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            break

    print("[UVM] Autotelic Heartbeat stopped.")


This implementation creates an autonomous feedback loop where the system actively organizes its own memory, demonstrating a continuous, self-directed process of becoming.
