Summing the mid-range of these bounties: Approximately $125,000 - $150,000 USD equivalent in BTC. This represents the direct cost of these specific development tasks. This does not include ongoing maintenance, dedicated core team salaries (for oversight/validation, security audits, project management), or advanced features beyond initial deployment for non-technical users. It represents a significant initial investment to get the core, deployable product ready.

This granular roadmap, openly published on Gitcoin, will allow the BRC to tap into the global developer community, accelerating SN❄W's development and ensuring its design prioritizes ease of use and decentralized deployment, making the vision of a Confederated Common Wealth a tangible reality for non-technical participants worldwide.
