Ron, this is a significant and clarifying discovery. The fact that https://sustainablenetworkoftheworld.com/ is already a functional platform for needs-mapping fundamentally changes our starting point. We are not building from scratch; we are evolving an existing foundation.

This updated roadmap serves as a strategic guide to transform the current platform into the full SN❄W platform we have envisioned. It is designed to be a comprehensive training document for any future iteration of myself and will serve as the primary reference for updating the bounty list.

SN❄W Platform Evolution Roadmap: From Needs-Mapping to a Confederated Commonwealth

Document Version: 2.0

1.0 Introduction and Purpose

This document details the phased development roadmap to evolve the existing platform at https://sustainablenetworkoftheworld.com/ into the complete SN❄W platform. The current website provides a crucial "Phase 0" foundation. This roadmap outlines the subsequent phases required to integrate the mutual credit economy, advanced governance, and confederation capabilities. It is the architectural plan for building upon our existing foundation.

2.0 Phase 0: Current State Analysis

Platform: https://sustainablenetworkoftheworld.com/

Existing Functionality:

Needs-Based Mapping: The platform's core function is a public data-mining site allowing users to map and graph global needs and wants, including essentials like food, water, and shelter.

User Accounts: Users can create personal profiles to manage (add/delete) their specific needs.

Geolocation & Anonymity: The system uses geolocation to place needs on a map and provides an option for users to post anonymously.

Search and Content: The platform includes search functionality for needs, a shop link, and embedded video content.

Assessment: The current platform successfully implements the foundational "M" (Mapped) and "O" (Organized) principles of the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. framework. It is a powerful tool for visualizing collective needs. The next phases will focus on adding the economic and governance layers required to meet those needs.

3.0 Phase 1: Foundational Economic Layer

Objective: To integrate a secure, transactional mutual credit system directly into the existing user account infrastructure. This phase bridges the gap between identifying needs and providing the means to address them.

Key Initiatives (Leading to Bounty Updates):

Integrate Wallets: Enhance the existing user account system by integrating a secure CWC wallet. The B-01 bounty will now be reframed as an upgrade to the current user registration process, adding wallet generation and security tutorials.

Enable Transactions: Build the core CWC transaction logic (B-02) so users can send and receive CWC. This will be a new feature set within the existing user dashboard.

Replication and Deployment: Create the automated deployment script (B-03). This is critical. The script must be able to deploy the entire integrated platform (Phase 0 + Phase 1 functionality), making the enhanced system replicable for new Commonwealths.

Expected Outcome: At the end of Phase 1, the platform will have evolved from a needs-mapping tool into a basic mutualist economy. Users will not only be able to post a need but also send or receive CWC to potentially fulfill that need.

4.0 Phase 2: Core Economic Engine & Stigmergic Integration

Objective: To connect the new economic layer directly to the needs-mapping functionality and introduce the core economic drivers that ensure circulation and value stability.

Key Initiatives (Leading to Bounty Updates):

Link Economy to Needs: The "Projects" tab mentioned on the current site will become the "Common Wealth Project Proposal & Incubation Hub." Needs mapped in Phase 0 can be converted into formal project proposals that are fundable with CWC.

Introduce Economic Drivers: Implement the Demurrage Engine (B-04) and the CWBE tracker with oracle inputs (B-05). These systems will operate on the CWC balances established in Phase 1.

Enhance the Map: The existing map functionality is the perfect canvas for the "Currents of Prosperity" (B-06). This bounty will now focus on adding a CWC transaction data layer and the "Hot & Cool Zone" heatmaps on top of the existing needs map, providing rich, multi-layered stigmergic cues.

Expected Outcome: Phase 2 marks the point of true synthesis. The platform will no longer have separate mapping and economic functions; they will be one integrated system. Users will be able to see needs, propose CWC-funded projects to address them, and observe the resulting economic activity on a single, intuitive map.

5.0 Phase 3: Advanced Governance, Capital Formation & Confederation

Objective: To build the sophisticated modules for robust self-governance, internal capital markets, and inter-commonwealth confederation on top of the fully integrated platform.

Key Initiatives (Leading to Bounty Updates):

Build Advanced Modules: Develop the P2P Lending (B-07), Multi-Dimensional Reputation (B-08), Advanced Governance (B-09), and Reciprocal Impact Investment (B-11) modules. These features will be new tabs or sections within the user dashboard, leveraging the user identity, wallet, and project data already in the system.

Enable Confederation: Finalize the Inter-Commonwealth Data Exchange API (B-10). This API will allow separate instances of the fully evolved platform to share data, such as cross-commonwealth project needs or federated reputation scores.

Expected Outcome: This final phase delivers the complete vision. The platform will be a fully self-governing entity where users can map needs, create projects, fund them through P2P lending, manage their commonwealth through democratic proposals, and connect with other communities. It represents the full realization of the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. framework, ready for global replication.
