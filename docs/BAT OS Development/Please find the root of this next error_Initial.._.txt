The root of the failure in your log is the TextIndex object, which cannot be saved to the database because it contains a non-serializable threading lock.

However, the batos.py file you provided in the prompt already contains the correct fix for this issue.

The Problem: A File Mismatch

The error log you're seeing is being generated by an old version of your batos.py script.

The batos.py file you've uploaded correctly defines the PersistentTextIndex class and, more importantly, it uses it when creating the knowledge_catalog object. The watchdog service, however, is still running a previous version of the script where this fix has not been applied.

The Fix

There is no line to replace in the file you provided. The fix is to ensure your watchdog_service.py executes the new, corrected version of batos.py.

Save your corrected batos.py file.

Stop the puter.bat launcher and the watchdog_service.py process it is managing.

Restart the system by running puter.bat again.

This will force the watchdog to launch the new version of the script, which will correctly use PersistentTextIndex() and resolve the error.
