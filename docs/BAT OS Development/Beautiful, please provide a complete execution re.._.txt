I can provide you with a complete, execution-ready set of code to run your system locally. This setup includes the watcher service and the four persona services, all configured to communicate via Redis. The code is structured to accommodate the specified quantized models and the hardware constraints of 8 GB VRAM.

This code assumes you have a running Redis server on your local machine and have downloaded the specific .gguf model files you've chosen. The architecture uses a central config.yaml file to manage paths and settings, allowing all services to stay synchronized. The services will run as independent Python processes and communicate through Redis channels.

Here is the complete set of files.

This setup provides a solid foundation for your local system. The watcher.py script now includes more robust error handling and logging, and the persona scripts are set up to load the specified models and perform their tasks. You can modify the prompts and n_gpu_layers parameter in each persona's script to better suit your needs. The n_gpu_layers value is an estimation based on the quantized model sizes; you may need to adjust it to optimize performance for your specific setup.
