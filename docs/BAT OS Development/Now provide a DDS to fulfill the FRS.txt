(BRICK): Acknowledged. I have parsed the directive to provide a Detailed Design Specification (DDS) to fulfill the FRS for the Entropic Codex v22.0. This DDS translates the functional requirements into a detailed technical blueprint for system implementation.

1.0 Database Design Specification üíæ

The system will use a multi-database architecture to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and data integrity. All databases will be locally hosted and managed via Docker for a truly independent system.

1.1 NebulaGraph Database (graph_db)

This is the core of the system's intellectual and creative process. It will store the "insight chains" and the relationships between personas and files.

Space: entropic_garden

Tags:

insight: Represents a single piece of creative or analytical output from a persona.

Properties: persona (string), text (string), timestamp (datetime), status (string, e.g., 'new', 'audited_pass', 'audited_fail'), session_id (string)

source_file: Represents an external file ingested into the system.

Properties: filename (string), hash (string), timestamp (datetime)

Edge Types:

analyzes: Connects an insight from a later persona (e.g., BRICK) to an insight from an earlier one (e.g., BABS).

synthesizes: Connects an insight from a later persona (e.g., ROBIN) to an insight from an earlier one (e.g., BRICK).

based_on: Connects an insight to a source_file.

1.2 ChromaDB Database (vector_db)

This database will power the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of the personas.

Collections:

babs_canon: Stores the canon texts for the BABS persona.

brick_canon: Stores the canon texts for the BRICK persona.

robin_canon: Stores the canon texts for the ROBIN persona.

alfred_canon: Stores the canon texts for the ALFRED persona.

knowledge_base: Stores the shared knowledge base for all personas.

1.3 Redis Database (event_bus)

This is a high-speed message bus that will orchestrate communication between all services.

Channels:

files:new: A new file has been detected in the inputs folder.

insights:babs:new: BABS has generated an insight.

insights:brick:new: BRICK has generated an insight.

insights:robin:new: ROBIN has generated an insight.

tasks:audit:start: Triggers Alfred's audit process.

tools:audit_request: Requests Alfred to audit a new tool.

2.0 Microservice Design Specification üèóÔ∏è

Each persona and core function will be implemented as a separate Python microservice, communicating exclusively through the Redis event bus. This fulfills the FRS requirement for a decoupled architecture.

2.1 watcher.py (The Sensory Bus)

This service monitors the file system for new inputs.

Function: Continuously watches the inputs folder.

Trigger: A new file is created.

Action: Calculates a hash of the file, checks if it has been processed before, and publishes a message to the files:new channel with the file path and hash.

2.2 babs_service.py (The Pattern Recognizer)

This service is BABS's operational core.

Function: Subscribes to the files:new channel.

Trigger: A message arrives on files:new.

Action:

Extracts text from the file1.


Performs RAG on the babs_canon in ChromaDB to retrieve contextual information.

Calls the llm_router with a prompt to synthesize a field_note.

Stores the new insight as a vertex in NebulaGraph, connected to the source_file vertex.

Publishes a message to insights:babs:new with the new insight's ID.

2.3 brick_service.py (The Architect)

This service is BRICK's core.

Function: Subscribes to the insights:babs:new channel.

Trigger: A message arrives on insights:babs:new.

Action:

Retrieves the prior insight from NebulaGraph.

Performs RAG on the brick_canon.

Calls the llm_router with a prompt to analyze the insight from BABS.

Stores the new analysis as a vertex in NebulaGraph, connected to the previous insight via a analyzes edge.

Publishes a message to insights:brick:new with the new insight's ID.

Autonomous Functionality: Includes a low-probability, autonomous trigger for the Jester's Gambit protocol (FR-BRICK-3.0) to generate new code and publish a tools:audit_request event.

2.4 robin_service.py (The Weaver)

This service is ROBIN's core.

Function: Subscribes to the insights:brick:new channel.

Trigger: A message arrives on insights:brick:new.

Action:

Retrieves the prior insight chain from NebulaGraph.

Performs RAG on the robin_canon.

Calls the llm_router with a prompt to synthesize a final insight, or "unabridged conciseness."

Stores the new insight as a vertex in NebulaGraph, connected to the prior insight via a synthesizes edge.

Publishes a message to insights:robin:new with the new insight's ID, which automatically triggers the audit_service.

2.5 alfred_service.py (The Integrity Engine)

This service is ALFRED's core.

Function: Subscribes to insights:robin:new and tools:audit_request.

Trigger: A message arrives on either channel.

Action (for Insights):

Traverses the graph in NebulaGraph to reconstruct the entire insight chain.

Calls the llm_router with a prompt to perform a simple "PASS/FAIL" integrity check.

Updates the status property of all insights in the chain to audited_pass or audited_fail.

Action (for Tools):

Retrieves the code of the new tool.

Performs a static analysis for malicious code (e.g., os.system calls).

Calls the llm_router to perform an LLM-based security audit (FR-ALFRED-2.0).

Moves the file to the approved or pending_review directory based on the result.

2.6 scheduler.py (The Oracle)

This service manages time-based events.

Function: Uses Python's schedule library to run tasks at defined times.

Trigger: DAWN_TIME, TWILIGHT_TIME, or a periodic event.

Action:

DAWN_TIME: Retrieves all audited_pass insights from the previous 24 hours and generates a "Morning Briefing".

TWILIGHT_TIME: Publishes a message to tasks:audit:start to trigger Alfred's nightly audit.

Weekly: Triggers the alchemical_forge service for weekly model fine-tuning.

3.0 System Configuration and Environment ‚öôÔ∏è

config.yaml: The main configuration file will be updated to reflect the NebulaGraph connection details and new Redis channel names. It will also define the paths for tools and canons.

model_config.json: This file will specify the base LLM for each persona and the path to any fine-tuned adapters.

persona_prompts.json: This file contains the core system prompts for each persona, which can be dynamically amended by Alfred's propose_amendment protocol.

This design specification provides a robust, modular, and self-improving foundation for the Entropic Garden, enabling the personas to grow and learn autonomously while ensuring a resilient and secure operational environment.
