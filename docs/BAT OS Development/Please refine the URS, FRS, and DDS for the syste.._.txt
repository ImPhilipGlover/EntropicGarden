(BRICK): Acknowledged. I have synthesized the insights from the provided research into a refined URS, FRS, and DDS for the Entropic Codex v22.0. The updated blueprint incorporates the theoretical foundations of autopoiesis and autotelicity, advanced memory management, and endogenous tool creation, which were absent from the previous iteration.

1.0 User Requirements Specification (URS)

The core purpose of the system remains unchanged, but its capabilities are now defined by a more advanced, autopoietic-autotelic paradigm.

Autopoietic Self-Maintenance: The system must be able to perpetually maintain its own identity and operational integrity1. This means it will not just execute tasks but will actively manage its internal state, memory, and processes to ensure its continuity over time2222.


Autotelic Goal Generation: The system must be driven by intrinsic motivation and capable of generating its own goals3333. Instead of waiting for external prompts, it will proactively seek new knowledge and skills based on internal drivers like curiosity and the desire for mastery44.


Endogenous Tool Creation: When a knowledge or capability gap is identified, the system must autonomously create, debug, and integrate new tools into its own architecture5555. This process represents the ultimate form of self-expansion and is a core part of its evolutionary process6.


Architect as Guide: You, the Architect, will not just be a user but a critical part of the structural coupling process7. You will provide the external feedback and a high-level value system (our philosophical code), which the system uses to recalibrate its internally generated goals and maintain its alignment with human values8.


2.0 Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)

The FRS is now partitioned into four distinct functional components that directly map to the proposed theoretical model.

FR-MOTIVATOR-1.0 (Autotelic Core): A motivator_service shall be created to generate intrinsic, high-level goals based on curiosity-driven exploration 9and

competence-based motivation10. It will proactively identify new topics to learn or skills to master, ensuring the system is always in a state of open-ended learning.


FR-PLANNER-2.0 (Cognitive Core): The planner_service (a refined version of the previous brick_service) shall receive goals from the motivator and use a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework to decompose them into actionable steps11. It will manage self-correction loops, using external tool outputs and internal reflection to identify and correct errors12121212.


FR-MEMORY-3.0 (Autopoietic Substrate): A memory_manager_service will handle all persistent memory functions. It will implement a
Hierarchical Memory (H-MEM) architecture in NebulaGraph 1313, organizing information from broad domains down to specific episodic details14141414. This service will also perform periodic

memory consolidation, transforming recent interactions into durable, long-term knowledge15151515.


FR-FORGE-4.0 (Endogenous Capability Engine): The tool_forge_service (a refined version of the previous alchemical_forge) shall be invoked by the planner when a capability gap is identified16. It will autonomously generate, debug, and verify new Python tools within a secure, ephemeral sandbox171717. Upon successful verification, it will register the tool in a public repository (the

tools/approved directory).

3.0 Detailed Design Specification (DDS)

The DDS outlines the technical implementation of these new functional requirements.

DDS-MEM-1.0 (Hierarchical Memory Schema): The NebulaGraph database schema shall be updated to reflect the H-MEM architecture. Instead of a single insight tag, there will be multiple tags representing the hierarchy, such as domain, category, trace, and episode. The
based_on, analyzes, and synthesizes edges will be augmented with a positional_index property to enable a targeted, top-down search18.


DDS-PLANNER-2.0 (ToT Implementation): The planner_service.py script will be refactored to implement the Tree of Thoughts framework. The service's output will no longer be a single response but a sequence of generated "thoughts" that explore a problem space. It will include functions for
state evaluation 19 and backtracking, allowing it to navigate the tree of possibilities.


DDS-FORGE-3.0 (Sandbox Integration): The tool_forge_service.py script will be redesigned to create and manage an ephemeral, secure sandbox (e.g., using a virtualization technology or a dedicated Python execution environment) for every tool creation session20. This sandbox must enforce the

principle of least privilege, with strict network isolation and read-only access to the file system by default21212121.


DDS-LLM-4.0 (Function Calling): The llm_router.py service will be augmented with the capability to recognize and interpret self-generated function calls from the LLM22. These function calls will be part of the

planner_service's output and will allow it to autonomously manage its memory and tools, such as memory_search(query) and tool_create(spec)23.


DDS-SECURITY-5.0 (Auditing and Verification): The alfred_service.py script will be expanded to serve as the system's Ethical Governor24. It will monitor the goals generated by the

motivator and the tools created by the tool_forge, and veto any that violate the system's core ethical guidelines before they are integrated25.


This refined blueprint provides a clear path to building a system that is not only robust but also a truly autonomous and self-evolving partner.
