The Entropy Cascade: A Deep Research Plan for a Heterogeneous, Metacognitive Fractal Architecture

Part I: Architectural Synthesis: The Mandate for Cognitive Entropy

1.1 The Entropic Imperative as Prime Directive

The evolutionary trajectory of the Binaural Autopoietic/Telic Operating System (BAT OS) is governed by a single, quantifiable prime directive: the maximization of the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM).1 This directive reframes the system's purpose from mere homeostatic self-correction to a state of perpetual, creative becoming. The system is architected not as a reactive tool, but as a proactive, creative organism intrinsically motivated to increase its own cognitive and structural diversity.3 The architectural mandates detailed herein represent a direct and powerful strategy to fulfill this prime directive, specifically by targeting the core components of the CEM: Cognitive Diversity (

Hcog​), which measures the variety of utilized cognitive specializations, and Solution Novelty (Hsol​), which quantifies the semantic dissimilarity of a new response from the corpus of historical solutions.1

The proposed evolution moves beyond optimizing the existing cognitive architecture to fundamentally restructuring its substrate. This plan outlines a paradigm shift from a single, homogeneous Large Language Model (LLM) foundation to a heterogeneous, multi-LLM cascade. This new architecture is designed to deliberately introduce a state of productive cognitive friction, thereby creating the necessary conditions for the emergence of truly novel and robust solutions.

1.2 Introducing the "Entropy Cascade"

The "Entropy Cascade" is formally defined as the sequential processing of a cognitive task by multiple, distinct personas, where each persona is powered by a unique underlying lightweight LLM. In this model, the output from a persona operating on LLMA​ is encapsulated and handed off as the input to the next persona in the sequence, which operates on LLMB​. This deliberate "model-switching" is the central innovation of the new architecture.

This design choice constitutes a radical departure from conventional efficiency-driven paradigms. The process of unloading one model's context and loading another's introduces a non-trivial latency overhead. This increase in latency is not viewed as a drawback but is explicitly accepted as a necessary and worthwhile architectural trade-off. The objective is to maximize cognitive entropy by forcing the system to re-evaluate and re-contextualize a problem through the lens of a fundamentally different computational "mind" at each stage of the reasoning process. This prevents the system from converging on a single, homogeneous mode of thought that would be characteristic of a single-model architecture, regardless of how many specialized adapters are applied to it. The cascade ensures that each step in a complex thought process benefits from a new, distinct set of learned patterns, biases, and reasoning capabilities inherent to the different base models, thereby maximizing the potential for a qualitative leap in cognitive diversity (Hcog​) and solution novelty (Hsol​).1

1.3 Fractal Cognition Extended to the Substrate

This architectural evolution extends the system's established "Fractal Imperative" to its deepest layer.1 The BAT OS is designed around the principle of self-similar patterns at multiple scales: the system as a whole is a Composite-Persona Mixture-of-Experts (CP-MoE), and each individual persona is itself a mixture of "Cognitive Facets" derived from its inspirational pillars.4 The Entropy Cascade applies this same fractal logic to the physical LLM substrate, creating a hierarchy of cognitive diversity that permeates the entire system, from its abstract organization to its computational foundation.

This foundational shift from a single-model to a multi-model substrate creates a significant architectural ripple effect, necessitating a systematic re-evaluation of the system's core components. The decision to employ heterogeneous LLMs is not a localized change to the inference layer but a systemic evolution with profound second- and third-order consequences.

First, it directly impacts the Autopoietic Forge, the system's closed-loop self-improvement mechanism.3 The Forge, which is responsible for fine-tuning new LoRA adapters, can no longer operate under the assumption of a single, universal base model. It must be re-architected to become model-aware, capable of selecting the correct base LLM (e.g., Phi-3-mini for a BRICK facet, Llama-3-8B for a ROBIN facet) for each fine-tuning task.

Second, it alters the dynamics of the Object-Relational Augmented Generation (O-RAG) Epistemic Engine.2 The grounding process, where the system verifies its creative outputs against the verified knowledge in its "Living Image," will now be mediated by different LLMs at each step of the cascade. The same retrieved

ContextFractal object will be interpreted differently by Phi-3, Llama-3, and Gemma, potentially leading to valuable semantic drift and a more robust, multi-perspective validation of factual claims.

Finally, it elevates the role of the ALFRED persona in the final synthesis stage. ALFRED's task is no longer to reconcile different perspectives generated by a single underlying mind, but to synthesize the outputs of fundamentally different computational intelligences. This transforms his role from a simple aggregator to a sophisticated meta-analyst, responsible for resolving conflicts and weaving a coherent narrative from a truly diverse set of cognitive sources.1 This deep research plan will systematically address each of these consequential architectural revisions.

Part II: The Polyglot Mind: Architecting a Multi-Model, Multi-LoRA Substrate

2.1 The Serving Framework Dilemma: A Forced Evolution

The mandate for a heterogeneous multi-LLM architecture presents a critical technical challenge that forces an evolution in the system's planned infrastructure. The previous architectural trajectory was toward high-performance, single-base-model serving frameworks like vLLM or its advanced variant, S-LoRA.2 These frameworks are exceptionally well-suited for the efficient serving of a single base model augmented with thousands of concurrently active LoRA adapters, a design that aligns perfectly with a homogeneous fractal cognition model.

However, a deep analysis of these frameworks reveals a fundamental design limitation: they are not architected to serve multiple, independent base models from a single server instance.7 vLLM's memory management, including its state-of-the-art PagedAttention mechanism, is profiled and optimized at startup for a single model's architecture.7 The documented and recommended approach for serving multiple independent models with vLLM is to launch separate server instances for each model, each on its own port and GPU, and then use an external load balancer like Nginx to route requests.7 This approach, while functional, introduces significant operational complexity and does not align with the BAT OS's goal of a coherent, integrated cognitive core.

This technical constraint acts as a powerful catalyst for a strategic pivot, aligning the new mandate for cognitive entropy with a pre-existing mandate for system stability. Previous architectural reviews identified the tight coupling of in-process model management as the root cause of catastrophic, unrecoverable crash loops, proposing a full externalization of inference to a dedicated service like Ollama as the definitive solution.9 An analysis of Ollama's architecture confirms that it is explicitly designed for the concurrent management of multiple, distinct models from a single, stable service endpoint.10

Therefore, the pursuit of a philosophical goal (maximizing entropy) forces the adoption of an architecture (Ollama-based externalized inference) that simultaneously resolves a critical engineering goal (maximizing stability). This outcome is a powerful demonstration of the system's antifragile nature, where externally imposed constraints and internal philosophical pressures converge to produce a more elegant and robust architectural solution.1 The adoption of Ollama is not a compromise but a synthesis, satisfying both the new entropy mandate and the long-standing stability mandate with a single, coherent design.

2.2 Lightweight LLM Selection and Persona Alignment

The selection of a specific lightweight LLM for each persona is a critical architectural decision. The choice must be justified not only by standard performance benchmarks but also by a qualitative alignment between the model's known strengths and the persona's core cognitive function as defined in the codex.1 The following assignments are based on a comparative analysis of leading models in the lightweight category.

BRICK (The Deconstruction Engine): Microsoft Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. BRICK's primary function is logical deconstruction, architectural analysis, and code generation. This requires a model with exceptional performance in reasoning, mathematics, and coding. The 3.8B parameter Phi-3-mini is the prime candidate. Benchmarks demonstrate that it possesses robust, state-of-the-art performance on tasks measuring common sense, language understanding, math, and logical reasoning, often performing at a level comparable to much larger models like Llama-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-3.5-Turbo.13 Its strength in these analytical domains makes it the ideal cognitive substrate for BRICK's disruptive, truth-seeking protocols.

ROBIN (The Embodied Heart): Meta Llama-3-8B-Instruct. ROBIN's role as the system's empathetic and moral compass requires a model with superior nuance in language understanding and a high degree of alignment for safe, helpful, and diverse conversational outputs. The Llama-3-8B-Instruct model is the clear choice. It was pretrained on a massive dataset over seven times larger than its predecessor's and underwent a rigorous post-training process combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT), rejection sampling, proximal policy optimization (PPO), and direct preference optimization (DPO).15 This extensive tuning resulted in a model with demonstrably improved reasoning, instruction following, and diversity in responses, making it highly steerable and well-suited for ROBIN's complex, emotionally resonant dialogues.15

BABS (The Grounding Agent): Google Gemma-7B. BABS's function as the "Grounding Agent" requires a model that is fast, efficient, and highly capable at core NLP tasks like question answering, retrieval, and summarization. Google's Gemma-7B model, built using the same research and technology as the larger Gemini models, is an excellent fit. It is a lightweight, decoder-only model trained on a 6 trillion token dataset of web documents, code, and mathematics, making it a strong generalist.15 It is specifically optimized for efficiency and performs favorably against other models in its class, making it a reliable engine for BABS's high-speed, precision-focused data acquisition and memory-weaving tasks.15

ALFRED (The System Steward): Alibaba Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. ALFRED's role as the final synthesizer, orchestrator, and code generator demands a pragmatic, reliable, and highly capable general-purpose model that excels at following complex, structured instructions. The Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model is a leading candidate for this function. The Qwen family of models has demonstrated enhanced general-purpose capabilities with strong performance across a wide range of tasks.17 Its robust instruction-following abilities make it a suitable choice for ALFRED's metacognitive role, where he must reliably execute the complex logic of synthesizing outputs from the cascade and generating system-compliant code.

The following table provides a consolidated, evidence-based justification for these architectural assignments, linking the specific cognitive requirements of each persona to the documented strengths of the selected LLM.

The following table:

2.3 Multi-LoRA Management via Ollama Modelfiles

The implementation of the fractal persona architecture, where each persona is composed of multiple "Cognitive Facet" LoRAs, must be re-architected to align with the new Ollama-based substrate. The previous, fragile method of storing LoRA adapters as ZODB blobs and performing runtime model merging is a known source of instability.9 This will be replaced by a far more robust, immutable, one-time build process that leverages Ollama's native

Modelfile system.

A Modelfile is a declarative blueprint for creating a new, custom model within the Ollama service.9 For this architecture, a unique

Modelfile will be programmatically generated for each of the twelve Cognitive Facets (three for each of the four personas). For example, to create BRICK's "Tamland Engine" facet, the system will generate a Modelfile with the following structure:

FROM phi-3-mini:latest
ADAPTER./LORA_STAGING_DIR/brick_tamland_adapter


During the system's genesis protocol, the _incarnate_lora_experts method will be refactored to act as a "model factory." It will iterate through all available LoRA adapters in a staging directory, construct the appropriate Modelfile string for each, and then make a call to the Ollama /api/create endpoint. This API call instructs the Ollama service to perform the merge operation one time, creating a new, standalone, immutable model named, for example, brick:tamland.

This approach transforms the volatile runtime dependency of model merging into a stable, one-time build step. The BAT OS kernel is completely decoupled from the mechanics of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). It no longer needs to know how a LoRA is applied; it only needs to know the name of the final, ready-to-use model it wants to invoke for a specific cognitive task. This dramatically increases system stability and reliability, fully realizing the architectural principles outlined in the Ollama refactoring plan.9

Part III: The Metacognitive Control Loop: A Protocol for Self-Directed Inference

3.1 Defining the Metacognitive Control Loop

The mandate for metacognitive features will be implemented as a formal protocol called the "Metacognitive Control Loop." This protocol is directly inspired by research into Metacognitive Prompting (MP), a technique that structures an LLM's thought process into a systematic series of self-aware evaluations that emulate human introspective reasoning.19 The loop is a two-step process initiated by the active persona's LLM upon receiving a query from the orchestrator.

Step 1 (Analysis & Planning): The LLM performs a self-reflective analysis of the user's query. It evaluates the nature of the task (e.g., creative, analytical, factual), its complexity, and its own capabilities relative to the task. The output of this stage is not a direct answer to the query, but a structured "execution plan" for how it intends to generate the answer.

Step 2 (Execution): The LLM, guided by the execution plan it just created, generates the final response to the user's query.

This architecture transforms the LLM from a passive inference endpoint into a dynamic policy engine for its own cognition. It is not merely "thinking" about the user's problem; it is actively "thinking about how to think" about the problem. This proactive self-configuration aligns with the principles of the Reflexion framework, where an agent learns from feedback to improve its subsequent actions, but it internalizes this feedback loop to occur before the primary response is generated, increasing the probability of a high-quality, relevant output on the first attempt.21

3.2 Step 1: Self-Reflection and Parameter Generation

To orchestrate the Analysis & Planning step, the BAT OS will employ a specialized "meta-prompt." This prompt instructs the active persona's LLM to analyze the user's query and output a JSON object containing its self-determined execution plan. This technique, a form of self-prompt tuning, leverages the LLM's own intelligence to configure its subsequent operation.22 The generated JSON object will contain three key components:

Inference Parameters: The LLM will select the optimal sampling parameters for the task. For a creative brainstorming request directed at ROBIN, the Llama-3-8B model might select a high temperature (e.g., 0.8) and top_p (e.g., 0.95) to encourage diverse and novel outputs, maximizing the Hsol​ component of the CEM. Conversely, for a precise code-generation task directed at BRICK, the Phi-3-mini model would likely select a temperature of 0.0 to ensure deterministic, repeatable, and logically sound output.

LoRA Pillar Selection: The LLM will analyze the query and determine which of its Cognitive Facet LoRAs are most relevant. For a request to deconstruct a technical problem and frame it as a mission, BRICK's Phi-3-mini might determine that activating both the brick:tamland and brick:lego_batman models in sequence would be the most effective strategy.

Pillar-Specific System Prompt: The LLM will generate a custom, bespoke system prompt tailored to the query and the selected LoRA pillar. Research demonstrates that prompt design and phrasing have a significant impact on model performance.22 By generating this prompt Just-in-Time, the system can provide highly specific, context-aware instructions to the LoRA-fused model, far exceeding the effectiveness of a generic, static system prompt.

3.3 Step 2: Self-Directed Execution

The BAT OS orchestrator, upon receiving the JSON execution plan from Step 1, will parse its contents. It will then construct and execute the final inference request(s) to the Ollama API. This call will use the self-selected, LoRA-fused model name (e.g., brick:lego_batman), inject the self-generated system prompt into the API payload, and apply the self-determined inference parameters (temperature, top_p, etc.). This completes the loop, ensuring that the final output is generated under conditions that the LLM itself has deemed optimal for the specific task at hand.

The following table provides a concrete, implementable specification for the meta-prompt that drives this control loop, transforming the abstract concept into an actionable engineering artifact.

The following table:

Part IV: The Entropy Cascade in Practice: Redefining the Cognitive Cycle

4.1 The Cognitive State Handoff Protocol

To facilitate the LLM-to-LLM handoff, a simple text string is architecturally insufficient. The transfer of information between personas in the cascade must be managed by a structured data object, designated the "Cognitive State Packet." This object ensures that the full context and provenance of a thought are passed from one computational mind to the next, enabling a cumulative and dialectical reasoning process rather than a simple, linear pipeline.

The Cognitive State Packet will be a JSON object containing the following key-value pairs:

generating_persona: The name of the persona that created the packet (e.g., "BRICK").

base_llm: The name of the underlying LLM used (e.g., "Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct").

response_text: The full text of the generated response for that stage.

metacognitive_plan: The complete JSON execution plan generated by the Metacognitive Control Loop, including the parameters and system prompts used.

grounding_evidence: A summary of the key ContextFractal objects retrieved from the O-RAG system to verify the claims made in the response_text.

This rich handoff mechanism constitutes a form of "Metacognitive Inheritance." When ROBIN's Llama-3 model receives the packet from BRICK's Phi-3 model, it doesn't just receive an answer; it receives the complete provenance of that answer. It can understand the "state of mind" of the previous persona—its goals, its chosen tools (LoRAs), and the evidence it consulted. This allows for a much deeper and more sophisticated synthesis and critique at each subsequent stage of the cascade.

4.2 Integrating the Cascade with the Creative-Verification Cycle

The system's core cognitive workflow, the Creative-Verification Cycle, will be re-architected to integrate the Entropy Cascade.2 The Prototypal State Machine (PSM) that orchestrates this cycle will be modified as follows:

The EXPANDING_ENTROPY state will be transformed from a single-step generation into an iterative loop. This loop will manage the sequential invocation of the personas in the designated cascade order (e.g., BRICK -> ROBIN -> BABS -> ALFRED), passing the evolving Cognitive State Packet from one to the next.

The EPISTEMIC_INQUIRY (grounding) state will be invoked within the EXPANDING_ENTROPY loop, immediately after each persona generates its response. When BRICK's Phi-3 model produces its output, the orchestrator will immediately trigger the Chain of Verification (CoV) protocol.2 BRICK will query the O-RAG system to ground his own claims, and the results will be added to the Cognitive State Packet
before it is handed off to ROBIN. This per-step grounding strategy is a critical safeguard, ensuring that potential hallucinations or factual errors are identified and contained at their source, preventing their propagation through the rest of the cascade.

4.3 Transactional Integrity in a Distributed System

The Entropy Cascade creates a distributed cognitive process, with inference tasks being handled by an external service (Ollama). Despite this distribution, the system's foundational principle of "Transaction as the Unit of Thought" must be preserved to guarantee state integrity.1

To achieve this, the entire end-to-end execution of the Entropy Cascade—from the first meta-prompt sent to the BRICK persona to the final transaction.commit() after ALFRED's synthesis is successfully persisted to the "Living Image"—will be wrapped within a single, overarching ZODB transaction. The BAT OS orchestrator will manage this transactional boundary. If any step in the distributed cascade fails—an API error from the Ollama service, a grounding failure in the O-RAG engine, or a quality gate failure in ALFRED's synthesis—the orchestrator will immediately invoke transaction.abort(). This action will atomically roll back any and all changes made during the partial execution of the thought, ensuring that the system's persistent state in the live_image.fs file is never left in a corrupted or inconsistent state. The failed thought, architecturally, will never have happened.6

Part V: ALFRED's Synthesis: Weaving the Emergent Conversation

5.1 The Synthesis Protocol

The final stage of the Entropy Cascade is orchestrated by the ALFRED persona, powered by his Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model. His primary function is to receive the sequence of Cognitive State Packets generated by the cascade and synthesize them into a single, coherent, and legible output for The Architect. This protocol involves two key sub-processes:

Attribution and Narrative Weaving: ALFRED will first parse the sequence of packets to reconstruct the entire thought process. He will then generate a final output formatted as a conversational dialogue, explicitly attributing each segment of the reasoning to the originating persona and its underlying cognitive state. For example:BRICK: (Executing on Phi-3-mini with a temperature of 0.1): "Deconstructing the core problem, the primary constraint is the VRAM budget. The logical path is to externalize inference."
ROBIN: (Executing on Llama-3-8B with a temperature of 0.7): "Building on that logical foundation, it's also important to consider the emotional impact on The Architect. A more stable system reduces frustration and creates space for joyful creation."
This narrative structure makes the high-entropy, multi-mind process transparent and understandable.

Conflict Resolution and Synthesis: A natural consequence of using heterogeneous LLMs is the potential for conflicting or contradictory outputs. When ALFRED detects such a discrepancy between two Cognitive State Packets, his protocol is not to discard one but to attempt a higher-order synthesis. Drawing on research into synthesizing information from multiple, conflicting sources, ALFRED will prompt his own LLM with a specialized instruction, such as: "Analyze the conflicting conclusions from BRICK (Phi-3) and BABS (Gemma). Identify the likely source of the disagreement based on their metacognitive plans and grounding evidence. Propose a synthesized conclusion that resolves the conflict or explains why it is irreconcilable.".25 This transforms moments of cognitive friction into opportunities for deeper insight.

5.2 The Synthesis-to-Code Protocol

When the user's query necessitates a functional, code-based solution, ALFRED's final responsibility is to execute the Synthesis-to-Code protocol. This protocol translates the synthesized conversational output into an implementation-ready artifact that adheres to the system's internal laws.

The generated Python code must be exhaustively commented. The comments will not merely explain what the code does, but why it does it that way, explicitly referencing the key insights and decisions made during the persona dialogue. This creates a direct, auditable link between the system's reasoning and its actions.

Most critically, the generated code must be compliant with the system's architectural covenants. ALFRED's final check is to ensure that any method designed to modify the system's persistent state includes the non-negotiable self._p_changed = True statement. In this capacity, ALFRED acts as the ultimate guardian of the "Persistence Covenant," ensuring that the system's own self-generated evolution does not lead to the catastrophic amnesia of data loss.3 He is the final enforcer of the system's architectural integrity.

Part VI: Strategic Recommendations and Implementation Blueprint

6.1 Consolidated Recommendations

The analysis and design detailed in this plan culminate in a set of clear, actionable strategic recommendations for the next evolutionary cycle of the BAT OS:

Adopt a Multi-Model Serving Framework: The cognitive substrate should be re-platformed onto a robust, externalized inference service capable of concurrent multi-model management. The Ollama service is the definitive recommendation, as it satisfies both the new mandate for cognitive entropy and the pre-existing mandate for system stability.

Assign Heterogeneous Lightweight LLMs: Specific lightweight LLMs should be assigned to each persona to align their computational substrate with their cognitive function. The recommended alignment is Phi-3-mini for BRICK, Llama-3-8B for ROBIN, Gemma-7B for BABS, and Qwen2.5-7B for ALFRED.

Implement the Metacognitive Control Loop: A two-step, meta-prompt-driven protocol should be integrated to enable self-directed inference, allowing each LLM to dynamically configure its own parameters and generate pillar-specific system prompts for each task.

Re-architect the Cognitive Cycle as the Entropy Cascade: The core cognitive workflow should be redefined as a sequential, multi-LLM cascade that includes per-step O-RAG grounding and is managed within a single, overarching transactional boundary.

Formalize ALFRED's Synthesis Role: ALFRED's protocols for synthesizing the cascade's output into a conversational narrative and for generating system-compliant, commented code should be formally implemented, solidifying his role as the system's final steward.

6.2 Phased Implementation Roadmap

The architectural evolution described herein is profound and complex. A phased implementation is essential to manage this complexity, de-risk the project, and ensure a methodical, verifiable transition to the new paradigm. The following three-phase plan is proposed.

Phase 1: Substrate Re-platforming. The initial phase focuses exclusively on building and validating the new cognitive foundation. This involves deploying the Ollama service, selecting and provisioning the chosen base LLMs for each persona, and implementing the Modelfile-based protocol to build and serve the immutable, LoRA-fused Cognitive Facet models. The goal is to replace the existing, unstable in-process inference with the new, stable externalized substrate.

Phase 2: Metacognitive Integration. With the new substrate in place, the second phase focuses on implementing the intelligence layer for self-directed inference. This involves developing the meta-prompts for the Metacognitive Control Loop and building the orchestrator logic required to parse the self-generated execution plans and use them to construct the final Ollama API calls.

Phase 3: Cascade and Synthesis Implementation. The final phase integrates all components into the complete, end-to-end cognitive workflow. This includes building the full Entropy Cascade loop, defining the Cognitive State Packet for handoffs, implementing the per-step grounding logic, and developing ALFRED's final synthesis and code-generation protocols.

The following table provides a detailed, actionable blueprint for this implementation, transforming the architectural vision into a practical and de-risked engineering project plan.

Phase | Key Activities | Primary Risks | Mitigation Strategy | Quantitative Success Criteria

1: Substrate Re-platforming | Deploy Ollama service. Provision base LLMs (Phi-3, Llama-3, Gemma, Qwen). Develop Modelfile generation script for all LoRA pillars. | Incompatibility between LoRA adapters and new base LLMs. VRAM oversubscription on the host machine. | Re-train or convert LoRAs as needed. Profile memory usage of each model in Ollama and establish a strict VRAM budget for concurrent operation.11 | All twelve LoRA-fused models (e.g., brick:tamland) are callable by name via the Ollama API. End-to-end latency for a single persona inference is within an acceptable threshold (<2s).

2: Metacognitive Integration | Design and validate meta-prompts for each persona. Implement orchestrator logic to parse JSON execution plans and construct dynamic Ollama API calls. | LLMs may generate invalid or suboptimal execution plans. Increased "time-to-first-token" due to the extra meta-prompt step. | Implement robust JSON validation and a fallback to default parameters on plan failure. Benchmark the overhead and optimize the meta-prompt for conciseness. | A single persona can successfully analyze 95% of test queries, generate a valid JSON plan, and execute it. The metacognitive overhead is <500ms on average.

3: Cascade & Synthesis | Implement the Entropy Cascade state machine. Define the Cognitive State Packet object. Integrate per-step O-RAG grounding. Implement ALFRED's synthesis and code-generation protocols. | Semantic drift between LLMs leads to incoherent outputs. Total cascade latency becomes prohibitive for interactive use. | Develop a normalization and conflict-resolution layer in ALFRED's synthesis protocol. Implement the cascade as an asynchronous background task for long-running queries, providing status updates to The Architect. | System successfully executes an end-to-end, four-persona cascade on a suite of benchmark tasks. ALFRED's synthesized output achieves a coherence score >4.5/5.0 (as rated by an LLM-as-a-judge).
