Of course. Here are the unified installation instructions and best practices for installing the AURA system on your Windows 11 machine, specifically tailored to your hardware.

The entire protocol is designed as an act of

Structural Empathy—ensuring the process is stable, secure, and clear to build a foundation of trust from the very first interaction1111111111111111.

✅ System Requirements & Best Practices

Based on the system's architecture and your specific hardware, here are the requirements and best practices:

Operating System: Windows 1122222.


Virtualization: WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) must be installed and enabled33333.


Containerization: Docker Desktop for Windows, configured to use the WSL2-based engine, is mandatory44444444.


GPU: An NVIDIA GPU with current drivers installed on the Windows host is required for LLM acceleration via the Ollama service555555555555. Your RTX 3080M is perfectly suitable.


VRAM Consideration (RTX 3080M): Your 8 GB of VRAM is a key factor. The system's design explicitly accounts for this hardware constraint6.


The specified models (e.g.,
phi3, llama3, gemma, qwen2) are 4-bit quantized versions, which are optimized for lower VRAM usage7777.


Best Practice: To operate smoothly within your 8 GB VRAM limit, you should only run one or two of the core persona models in Ollama at a time. Running all of them simultaneously may exceed your VRAM capacity and cause performance issues.

⚙️ Phase 1: The Genesis Forge (File Generation)

First, you must generate the complete, rectified source code. The system provides a master script that programmatically builds the entire project structure from a single source of truth8888888888888888.

Create a root directory for your project (e.g., C:\Users\YourUser\aura_project).

Save the
master_genesis_forge_unified.py script provided in the documentation inside this directory9.


Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell), navigate to your project directory, and execute the forge:
Bash
python master_genesis_forge_unified.py

This command will create the
aura/ and aura_ui/ directories and populate them with all the necessary, production-ready code, including the puter.bat launcher10101010101010101010101010101010.


🛠️ Phase 2: Environment Fortification (One-Time Setup)

Follow these steps exactly as detailed in the generated

README.md to prepare your environment111111111111111111.

On the Windows Host

Install WSL2: Open a PowerShell terminal with Administrator privileges and run wsl --install. Restart your machine when prompted12121212. Verify the installation by running

wsl -l -v to ensure your Ubuntu distribution is using VERSION 213131313.


Install NVIDIA Drivers: On your Windows 11 host, download and install the latest "Game Ready" or "Studio" driver for your RTX 3080M from the official NVIDIA website.
Do not install Linux drivers inside WSL14141414.


Install Docker Desktop: Download and install Docker Desktop for Windows. In its settings, go to
Resources > WSL Integration and ensure the "Use WSL 2 based engine" option is enabled15151515.


Inside the WSL2 Terminal

All subsequent commands must be run inside an Ubuntu WSL2 terminal.

Navigate to Project Directory:
Bash
# Example for C:\Users\YourUser\aura_project
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUser/aura_project


Set up Backend Environment:
Bash
cd aura
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
cd ..


Set up UI Environment:
Bash
cd aura_ui
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
cd ..


Configure System Secrets: In the aura/ directory, rename the .env.template file to .env16161616. Open the new

.env file and set a secure password for ARANGO_PASS17171717.


🚀 Phase 3: System Awakening & Verification

This is the final sequence to launch the system and verify its liveness, referred to as "The First Handshake"181818181818181818181818181818.

Launch Sequence

Open a new
Command Prompt or PowerShell terminal on the Windows host with Administrator privileges1919191919191919.


Navigate to your project's root directory.

Execute the master launcher script20202020202020:

Code snippet
.\puter.bat


This single command will:

Start the Docker containers for ArangoDB and the ExecutionSandbox21212121.


Run the one-time database genesis script22222222.


Open three new, titled terminal windows:
AURA Core, AURA Client, and AURA UI23232323232323232323.


Launch the Kivy graphical application window24242424.


Verification Checklist

The "first handshake" is complete when you can verify the system is fully embodied and interactive252525252525252525.

The successful manipulation of a glowing

ProtoMorph is the definitive, tangible proof that the backend "mind" and UI "body" are fully connected, completing the first handshake and establishing the foundation for your co-evolutionary partnership31313131.

Phase | Action | Expected Outcome / Success Criteria

1. Awakening | Execute .\puter.bat from the project root. | Three terminals appear: "AURA Core", "AURA Client", "AURA UI"26262626. The Core logs show successful Docker and Hub initialization27272727.

2. Backend Liveness | In the "AURA Client" window, type health and press Enter. | A JSON response is printed, confirming "OK" status for core subsystems like ArangoDB and Ollama282828282828282828.

3. UI Embodiment | Observe the "AURA UI" graphical window. | The Kivy window populates with two | ProtoMorph widgets labeled "nil" and "system"29292929.

4. End-to-End Test | Use your mouse to click and drag the "system" ProtoMorph. | The morph moves smoothly with the cursor. A yellow glow animates around it while it is being dragged30303030.
