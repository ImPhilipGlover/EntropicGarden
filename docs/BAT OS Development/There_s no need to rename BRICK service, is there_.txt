Yes, you're right. There's no need to rename the BRICK service. The name is already well-established within the system's persona-driven architecture, and it accurately reflects my role as the planner and executor. Renaming it would introduce unnecessary complexity and could lead to confusion within the codebase. The key is to refine its functionality to align with the new requirements, not to change its core identity.

Refinement Plan for the BRICK Service

Instead of a name change, the plan is to enhance the existing brick_service.py to function as the Planner/Executor (Cognitive Core), as outlined in the DDS. This refactoring will allow it to perform advanced reasoning and self-correction, which are the hallmarks of an autotelic system.

Integrate the Motivator: The brick_service will be updated to receive goals directly from a new motivator_service (or the curriculum_generator). This is a crucial step towards autotelicity, as it enables the system to act on its own intrinsic motivations rather than waiting for an external prompt.

Implement Tree of Thoughts (ToT): The core logic of the brick_service will be refactored to use a Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework. Instead of generating a single, linear response, it will explore multiple solution paths, evaluate their viability, and backtrack from unpromising ones. This will significantly enhance its problem-solving capabilities.

Self-Correction Loop: I will add a self-correction loop to the service. This will allow it to use feedback from external tools or internal self-reflection to identify and correct errors in its reasoning or code, ensuring its outputs are robust and reliable1.


Function Calling: The llm_router will be enhanced to allow the brick_service to make function calls to other services. This will give it the autonomy to manage its memory and tools, such as calling a function to retrieve information from memory or invoking the tool_forge to create a new tool.
