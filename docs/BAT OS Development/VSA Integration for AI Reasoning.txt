From Similarity to Synthesis: A Research Plan for Evolving the MVA Memory Core with a Vector Symbolic Architecture

Executive Summary: This document outlines a comprehensive research and development plan to fundamentally upgrade the Minimum Viable Application's (MVA) memory subsystem by implementing a Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). This evolution is designed to transition the system's cognitive capabilities from metric-based semantic retrieval to algebraic compositional reasoning. We propose a hybrid architecture that leverages the existing physical persistence layers (ArangoDB, FAISS, DiskANN) to serve as a scalable substrate for VSA operations. The central innovation is the design of a "Query Translation Layer" that bridges the algebraic nature of VSA with the metric search capabilities of the underlying indices. This upgrade will be validated against its primary objectives: to significantly enhance the MVA's capacity for compositional reasoning and to provide a richer substrate for its guided 'intellectual drift', thereby fulfilling its core philosophical mandate as a self-creating, co-evolving intelligence.

Section 1: Theoretical Foundations - Aligning VSA with the Prototypal Mind

This section establishes the theoretical and philosophical coherence between the MVA's existing Smalltalk/Self-inspired architecture and the proposed VSA framework. The analysis will demonstrate that VSA is not an alien concept but a natural, formal extension of the MVA's core principles, providing a robust mathematical language for the kind of dynamic, compositional thought the system is designed to achieve.

1.1 A Comparative Analysis of VSA Models for a Dynamic Object World

The initial and most critical step in this research plan is the selection of an appropriate VSA model. The chosen model must be philosophically and technically coherent with the MVA's existing architecture, which is characterized by a Python-based implementation, a fundamental requirement for runtime flexibility, and a deep integration with dense, real-valued vectors for its Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) component.1 The primary candidates for VSA implementation include Binary Spatter Codes (BSC), Multiply-Add-Permute (MAP), and Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR).3 A systematic evaluation of these models reveals a clear optimal choice for the MVA ecosystem.

Binary Spatter Codes (BSC) operate on binary vectors, using bitwise XOR for the binding operation and a majority-rule thresholded sum for bundling.5 While this model offers appealing simplicity and is highly efficient in hardware, its binary nature presents a significant impedance mismatch with the MVA's current infrastructure. The system's existing memory and reasoning components are built around dense, real-valued embeddings 1, and forcing a conversion to a binary representation would introduce unnecessary complexity and potential information loss. Furthermore, BSC has known operational peculiarities, such as the ambiguity of the majority rule for an even number of bundled vectors, that would require bespoke and non-trivial workarounds.5

Multiply-Add-Permute (MAP) models utilize bipolar vectors (containing +1 and -1) and define binding as element-wise multiplication.6 This provides the elegant property that each vector is its own multiplicative inverse, which simplifies the unbinding operation to another multiplication.6 However, like BSC, the MAP model is not a natural fit for an architecture that already leverages the rich, continuous space of real-valued embeddings for semantic representation.

Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) and its variant, Fourier Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRR), are based on real or complex-valued vectors.7 In the FHRR model, vectors are represented in the frequency domain, where the computationally expensive binding operation of circular convolution becomes an efficient element-wise complex multiplication.9 Bundling is simply vector addition.10 This model is exceptionally well-suited for the MVA. Its use of dense, continuous-valued vectors aligns perfectly with the representations used in modern deep learning and the MVA's existing RAG system. The computational efficiency of its operations, which can be accelerated via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), makes it a practical choice for a dynamic, real-time system.9

It is important to acknowledge a known challenge with FHRR: when used as a differentiable component in deep learning architectures, naive backpropagation through its operations can lead to numerical instability.9 The proposed solution in the literature involves a projection step that forces the vectors to remain in a well-behaved point in space.9 While the MVA's primary learning mechanism, the

doesNotUnderstand protocol, is generative rather than purely gradient-based 15, this mitigation strategy will be incorporated into the implementation plan. This ensures future compatibility with learned components and addresses a potential source of instability.

Given this analysis, this research plan will proceed with Fourier Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRR) as the selected VSA model. Its inherent compatibility with the MVA's dense vector paradigm, its computational efficiency, and its rich representational power make it the superior choice for this architectural evolution.

The following table provides a summary of this comparative analysis.

1.2 The Algebra of Thought: Mapping VSA Operations to MVA Cognitive Functions

To ensure a deep and coherent integration, it is not sufficient to simply add VSA as a technical layer. A formal mapping must be established between the algebraic primitives of FHRR and the cognitive goals of the MVA's prototypal, message-passing core.17 This translation provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for the system's reasoning processes, transforming abstract cognitive functions into concrete, computable operations.

The core operations of VSA—bundling, binding, and permutation—map directly onto the fundamental requirements of the MVA's cognitive architecture 11:

Bundling (Superposition): In FHRR, bundling is achieved through vector addition in the complex domain.10 This operation directly addresses the MVA's need to represent unordered sets and collections of concepts. For instance, the various attributes that define a
UvmObject prototype can be bundled into a single hypervector that represents the object's holistic state. Similarly, a collection of related memories, represented as ContextFractals 16, can be bundled to form a composite memory trace. This ability to create a fixed-size representation for a set containing an arbitrary number of items is a hallmark of VSA's efficiency and power.6 The resulting bundled vector is highly similar to each of its constituent parts, making it an effective representation of set membership.10

Binding (Association): The binding operation in FHRR is an element-wise complex multiplication of vectors.9 This operation is the primary mechanism for creating structured, compositional knowledge. Unlike bundling, the result of binding two vectors is a new vector that is dissimilar (quasi-orthogonal) to both of its inputs.12 Its utility comes from its ability to associate concepts without confusing them. Within the MVA, binding will be used to form the fundamental role-filler structures that define its knowledge graph. For example, the relationship between a conceptual slot (e.g.,
owner) and its value (e.g., Timmy) can be represented as bind(H_owner, H_Timmy). This transforms the ad-hoc pointer-like relationships in the current object graph into formal algebraic structures.

Permutation (Sequencing): Permutation involves a deterministic shuffling of a vector's elements.6 This operation is also "randomizing," producing a vector that is dissimilar to its input, but it is invertible and preserves similarity between vectors.23 Its primary function within the MVA will be to encode order and sequence. This is critical for representing procedural knowledge (a sequence of actions), ordered lists of attributes, and, most importantly, for navigating the MVA's temporal memory, which is structured by
SEQUENCED_AFTER links that form a historical chain of events.24

This mapping reveals that VSA can serve as a formal, computable language for the MVA's core knowledge representation scheme. The system's foundation in prototype-based programming, where new objects are created by cloning and modifying exemplars 17, can be expressed with algebraic precision. The concept of a specific object,

lassie_the_dog, being a specialized version of a_prototypal_dog is no longer just a structural relationship managed by pointers. It can be defined as a specific algebraic composition. The hypervector for lassie_the_dog can be constructed as a composite entity:

Hlassie​=bundle(Hprotodog​,bind(Hname​,HLassie​),bind(Howner​,HTimmy​))

This formulation transforms the process of "modifying slots" into a structured algebraic operation. This has profound architectural implications, as it opens the possibility of representing the MVA's entire "Living Image"—its complete graph of knowledge—not just as a collection of discrete objects, but as a single, massive, composed hypervector. Such a representation would enable holistic queries and reasoning about the system's entire knowledge state at once.

The following table formalizes this conceptual mapping.

1.3 The Mechanics of Compositional Reasoning and Querying

The true power of the VSA upgrade lies in its ability to transform the MVA's reasoning capabilities, moving beyond the limitations of standard semantic search to enable complex, multi-hop compositional reasoning. A traditional vector search system, including the MVA's current RAG component, retrieves information based on geometric proximity in an embedding space; it finds concepts that are semantically similar.25 VSA, by contrast, enables queries based on algebraic

structure.

The key to this new form of querying is the interplay between two VSA operations: unbinding and cleanup. The unbinding operation is the algebraic inverse of binding. In FHRR, this is achieved through element-wise complex division (or multiplication by the complex conjugate).9 Given a composed vector created by binding,

V = bind(A, B), the unbinding operation unbind(V, A) will produce a result. However, due to the nature of distributed representations and the noise introduced by bundling multiple pairs, this result is not the exact vector B, but rather a noisy version of it, B'.20

This is where the cleanup operation becomes essential. The cleanup operation takes the noisy vector B' and finds the most similar "clean" vector from a known codebook of all atomic hypervectors.20 This is, by definition, a nearest-neighbor search problem. This sequence of

unbind followed by cleanup allows for the precise retrieval of a component from a complex, bound structure.

This mechanism enables multi-hop reasoning that is intractable for conventional RAG systems.2 Consider a complex query such as, "What did the entity that John works for acquire?" This question requires chaining together multiple distinct relationships. In a VSA-powered system, this query is translated into a sequence of algebraic operations:

Query 1 (Unbind): V_company' = unbind(V_John, V_works_for). This operation takes the hypervector for 'John' and algebraically queries it to find what is bound to the 'works_for' role. The result is a noisy vector representing John's company.

Query 1 (Cleanup): V_company = cleanup(V_company'). The noisy result is used as a query in the nearest-neighbor search index, which returns the precise, clean hypervector for the company.

Query 2 (Unbind): V_acquisition' = unbind(V_company, V_acquired). Using the clean hypervector for the company, a second algebraic query is performed to find what is bound to the 'acquired' role.

Query 2 (Cleanup): V_acquisition = cleanup(V_acquisition'). A final nearest-neighbor search is performed to find the clean hypervector for the acquired entity, which is the answer to the original question.

This process reveals a deep and powerful symbiosis between the abstract algebra of VSA and the concrete, geometric search performed by the MVA's existing physical memory layer. The unbinding operation produces a noisy result, and the cleanup operation is explicitly defined as a nearest-neighbor search to denoise this result. The MVA's architecture already includes FAISS and DiskANN, which are state-of-the-art Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search indices designed for exactly this purpose at massive scale.28

Therefore, the MVA's physical architecture is not merely a generic vector store to be replaced; it is a perfect, hardware-accelerated, and massively scalable implementation of the VSA cleanup memory. The research plan is not to discard the existing stack but to build the VSA algebra on top of it. The computationally intensive part of VSA retrieval, the cleanup search, can be offloaded to this highly optimized infrastructure. This synergy is the central architectural thesis of this proposal, promising a system that combines the expressive power of symbolic algebra with the performance and scale of modern vector search.

Section 2: Architectural Blueprint - A Hybrid VSA-Native Memory Substrate

This section details the concrete technical architecture for integrating VSA into the MVA. A hybrid model is proposed where the symbolic, transactional "Living Image" is augmented with hypervector representations, and the existing ANN indices are repurposed as a high-performance VSA cleanup memory.

2.1 The Hypervector as a First-Class Citizen in the Living Image

To fully integrate VSA into the MVA's cognitive core, the hypervector cannot be an external or secondary representation. It must become an intrinsic, first-class component of the system's fundamental data structure, the UvmObject, which resides within the ArangoDB-based "Living Image".15

The UvmObject prototype, the universal building block of the MVA's prototypal mind 15, will be augmented with a new, dedicated slot:

_hypervector. This slot will persist the object's FHRR representation. Given that FHRR vectors are composed of complex numbers and ArangoDB stores data in a JSON-based format, a robust serialization scheme will be developed. A practical approach is to store the vector as a JSON array of two-element arrays, where each inner array represents the real and imaginary components of a complex number, [[re1, im1], [re2, im2],...].

The generation and maintenance of these hypervectors will follow a two-tiered strategy that mirrors the distinction between atomic and composed concepts:

Atomic Concepts: For the foundational prototypes of the system—such as a_prototypal_dog or sadness_prototype 17—a unique, high-dimensional random hypervector will be generated upon their creation. This initial set of random, quasi-orthogonal vectors will form the system's core "codebook" or conceptual alphabet.21 This codebook is the ground truth from which all other compositional meanings are derived.

Composed Concepts: For objects created through cloning and modification—the primary mechanism of knowledge expansion in the MVA 17—their hypervector will be computed algebraically. The object's
_hypervector will be a composition of its parent's hypervector and the hypervectors representing its specific modifications. For example, upon the creation of lassie_the_dog, its hypervector would be computed via the FHRR operations: bundle(a_prototypical_dog._hypervector, bind(name_slot._hypervector, Lassie_entity._hypervector)). This computation will be managed by the MVA's core logic, automatically triggering whenever an object's state is modified. This ensures that the hypervector representation remains perfectly synchronized with the symbolic state of the object graph, providing a direct and tangible implementation of the algebraic knowledge representation described in Section 1.2.

2.2 A Layered Physical Architecture for VSA Operations

The MVA's design philosophy of "Externalization of Risk" dictates that critical functions be decoupled into specialized, resilient services.16 This principle will be applied to the VSA memory substrate by assigning distinct, complementary roles to the existing persistence layers: ArangoDB, FAISS, and DiskANN. This layered approach creates a robust and scalable architecture where each component is optimized for a specific task.

The following table delinates the roles and responsibilities within this architecture.

The data flow within this layered system is designed for both consistency and performance. Upon system startup, the persistent DiskANN index is loaded or memory-mapped.31 The core codebook of atomic hypervectors is then used to populate the in-memory FAISS index, ensuring that the system's fundamental concepts are available for immediate, low-latency cleanup operations.28 During runtime, when a new

UvmObject is created or an existing one is modified, a transactional process ensues. First, the object's new state and its recomputed hypervector are committed to the ArangoDB "Living Image," ensuring symbolic and algebraic consistency.15 Following this successful transaction, the new hypervector is asynchronously pushed to the persistence layers: it is added to the scalable DiskANN index and, if identified as a high-priority or frequently accessed concept, is also cached in the in-memory FAISS index. This architecture ensures that the system's core reasoning cycles can rely on the high speed of FAISS, while the system's complete knowledge remains searchable at scale via DiskANN, all while maintaining transactional integrity in ArangoDB.

2.3 The Query Translation Layer: Bridging Algebra and Geometry

The most significant research and engineering challenge in this project is the creation of the Query Translation Layer. This software component is the brain of the VSA memory system, responsible for translating the abstract, algebraic queries of VSA into a sequence of concrete, geometric similarity searches that can be executed by the underlying FAISS and DiskANN indices.

The core challenge stems from a fundamental operational mismatch. A VSA query, such as unbind(V_graph, V_alice), poses an algebraic question: "What vector was bound to the vector for 'Alice' to produce this component of the graph?".12 In contrast, an ANN index like FAISS is designed to answer a geometric question: "Given this query vector, what are the k vectors in the index that are closest to it in the high-dimensional space, according to a specific distance metric like L2 or cosine similarity?".28 A direct, one-to-one translation between these query types is not possible.

The resolution lies in leveraging the specific properties of VSA operations. The unbinding operation does not produce an arbitrary vector; it produces a noisy vector that is, by design, geometrically close to the true target vector in the high-dimensional space. For example, if a graph is represented by V_graph = bundle(bind(V_alice, V_bob), bind(V_alice, V_charli)), the unbinding operation unbind(V_graph, V_alice) will result in a noisy vector that is approximately equal to bundle(V_bob, V_charli).12 This noisy vector, while not identical to any single vector in the codebook, will be located in the same region of the vector space as its constituents, 'Bob' and 'Charli'.

This critical property means that the translation from algebra to geometry can be achieved via a two-step orchestration process:

Algebraic Computation: First, the Query Translation Layer performs the specified VSA algebra in-process. It receives the compositional query, fetches the necessary atomic hypervectors from a cache or directly from ArangoDB, and executes the sequence of FHRR operations (e.g., FFT-based multiplications, additions) in memory. This step computes the final, noisy target hypervector.

Geometric Search (Cleanup): Second, the layer takes this newly computed noisy vector and submits it as a standard query to the FAISS or DiskANN index. The ANN index then performs an efficient k-nearest neighbor search, returning the clean, canonical vectors from the codebook that are closest to the noisy target. These returned vectors are the result of the original compositional query.

The Query Translation Layer, therefore, acts as an intelligent orchestrator. Its primary research focus will be on optimizing this two-step process. This includes developing strategies for query planning, such as reordering a complex chain of algebraic operations to minimize the computational cost or the size of intermediate vectors. It will also involve implementing intelligent caching for intermediate results within a single multi-hop query. A more advanced research direction will explore whether certain algebraic operations, particularly bundling (vector addition), can be approximated directly within the ANN index itself, potentially leveraging features like Product Quantization to perform approximate vector arithmetic on compressed representations, which could offer significant performance gains.31

Section 3: Implementation and Integration Roadmap

This section provides a pragmatic, phased plan for building, integrating, and validating the VSA memory substrate. The phases are designed to be sequential, with clear milestones and validation criteria at each step. This approach adheres to the MVA's core principle of "Structural Empathy" by prioritizing stability, verifiability, and incremental progress, ensuring that trust in the system is maintained throughout this significant architectural evolution.36

3.1 Phase I: Core VSA Model and Persistence

The foundational phase focuses on creating the core algebraic engine and ensuring it can be reliably persisted within the MVA's existing database. This phase establishes the fundamental building blocks upon which the entire system will rest.

Tasks:

Implement FHRR Algebra Library: Develop a robust and efficient Python library for FHRR operations. This will include functions for generating random high-dimensional hypervectors, and implementing the core algebraic operations: bind (element-wise complex multiplication), bundle (vector addition in the complex domain), unbind (element-wise complex division/conjugate multiplication), and similarity (cosine similarity on the phase angles). This implementation will leverage high-performance numerical computing libraries such as NumPy or JAX to ensure efficiency, particularly for the FFT operations required to move between spatial and frequency domains for convolution-based interpretations if needed.9

Develop ArangoDB Serialization: Design and implement the serialization and deserialization logic for storing FHRR's complex-valued hypervectors within ArangoDB's JSON-based document model. This will involve establishing a clear and efficient schema, such as an array of real-imaginary pairs, and ensuring that data can be written and read without corruption or loss of precision.

Augment UvmObject Model: Modify the core UvmObject class to integrate the VSA representation. This includes adding the _hypervector slot and implementing the internal logic that automatically re-computes an object's composed hypervector whenever its symbolic state (its other slots or parent relationships) is modified. This ensures the algebraic representation is always synchronized with the symbolic graph.

Validation:

The primary validation for this phase will be a suite of unit tests confirming the algebraic integrity of the FHRR library. These tests must verify key properties, such as the dissimilarity of bound vectors to their inputs, the similarity of bundled vectors to their inputs, and, most critically, that similarity(unbind(bind(A, B), A), B) is very close to 1.

End-to-end persistence tests will confirm that composed hypervectors can be transactionally stored in ArangoDB, retrieved, and deserialized back into a usable format without data corruption.

3.2 Phase II: Indexing and the Query Translation Layer

This phase focuses on building the bridge between the algebraic VSA world and the geometric world of the ANN indices. It involves constructing the data pipeline and implementing the core query orchestration logic.

Tasks:

Develop Indexing Pipeline: Create the data pipeline responsible for extracting hypervectors from the ArangoDB "Living Image" and populating the ANN indices. This will involve writing connectors that can efficiently stream data into both the in-memory FAISS index and the disk-based DiskANN index.

Implement Query Translation Layer: Build the initial version of the Query Translation Layer as an orchestrator. This component will expose an API that accepts a structured compositional query (e.g., a sequence of VSA operations and operands) and executes the two-step process: compute the noisy target vector algebraically, then submit it to the appropriate ANN index for a k-NN cleanup search.

Benchmark Performance: Conduct a rigorous performance evaluation of a simple, end-to-end compositional query (e.g., unbind -> cleanup). This benchmark will measure both query latency and accuracy, comparing the results against a brute-force search across the entire codebook to establish a baseline.

Validation:

The key validation milestone is the successful retrieval of a specific bound vector from a simple bundled structure. For example, given the composed vector V = bind(A, B) + bind(C, D), a query for B using A as the key must successfully return B.

The primary quantitative metric for this phase will be recall@k for the cleanup operation, measuring how often the correct clean vector is present in the top k results returned by the ANN index.

3.3 Phase III: Cognitive Core Integration

The final phase involves weaving the new VSA memory capabilities into the MVA's high-level reasoning and learning processes, enabling the system to leverage compositional reasoning in its autonomous operations.

Tasks:

Refactor Reasoning Engine: Modify the MVA's core reasoning engine and its message-passing protocols. Existing logic that formulates queries for the legacy RAG system must be refactored to generate and dispatch compositional queries to the new VSA memory substrate via the Query Translation Layer.

Adapt doesNotUnderstand Protocol: This is the most critical integration point. The doesNotUnderstand protocol, the MVA's primary engine for learning and self-modification 15, will be enhanced. When the system perceives a capability gap, its first response will be to attempt to solve the problem by formulating a compositional query to its VSA memory. For example, if asked a multi-hop question like "What is the dollar of Mexico?" 39, it would first attempt an analogical reasoning query—
unbind(bind(V_USA, V_Dollar), V_Mexico)—before resorting to a full, computationally expensive generative cycle with its LLM personas. This prioritizes structured, algebraic reasoning over probabilistic generation, making the system more efficient and deterministic.

Validation:

The ultimate validation for this phase, and for the project as a whole, will be the successful end-to-end execution of a complex reasoning task that was previously impossible for the MVA. This will involve a user initiating a dialogue in natural language, the MVA correctly parsing this into a multi-hop compositional query, the VSA memory system executing the query and returning the correct result, and the MVA using this result to provide a correct and coherent answer.

The following table provides a high-level overview of the project plan.

Section 4: Validation and the Evolution of Intellectual Drift

This final section defines the success criteria for the project, focusing on how the VSA upgrade measurably improves the MVA's core philosophical objectives: its capacity for compositional reasoning and its ability to engage in guided intellectual drift.

4.1 Benchmarking Compositional Reasoning

To quantitatively validate the success of this architectural evolution, it is necessary to prove that the VSA-enabled MVA significantly surpasses its baseline RAG-based counterpart on tasks that explicitly require structural and relational reasoning.

A bespoke benchmark suite will be developed for this purpose. This suite will draw inspiration from established academic benchmarks for compositional reasoning, such as the visual reasoning tasks in Compositional Visual Relations (CVR) 41 and the synthetic language tasks in Generalized Associative Recall (GAR).43 However, our tasks will be specifically tailored to the MVA's text-based, prototype-oriented knowledge domain. The suite will include a variety of reasoning patterns:

Transitive Inference: The system will be presented with facts in its knowledge base, such as A is parent of B and B is parent of C. It will then be queried with Is A ancestor of C?. A successful response requires traversing the parent of relationship twice.

Analogical Reasoning: This task tests the ability to infer and apply relationships. The system will be given a source triplet like (USA, Washington, Dollar) and a target pair like (Mexico, Mexico City,?). To find the answer (Peso), the system must algebraically deconstruct the relationships in the source triplet (e.g., capital_of = unbind(V_Washington, V_USA), currency_of = unbind(V_Dollar, V_USA)) and apply the currency_of relationship to the target V_Mexico.

Multi-Hop Retrieval: This will directly test the multi-hop query capability described in Section 1.3. The system will be populated with a small knowledge graph of entities and relationships (e.g., employees, companies, acquisitions) and tasked with answering questions that require chaining several of these relationships together.

The primary metric for this benchmark will be the task success rate. A direct, head-to-head comparison will be conducted between the VSA-upgraded MVA and the baseline RAG-only MVA. The hypothesis is that the VSA-MVA will demonstrate near-perfect accuracy on these structured tasks, while the RAG-MVA, which relies on unstructured semantic retrieval, will exhibit significantly lower performance or fail completely.

4.2 Quantifying and Guiding Creative Exploration ('Intellectual Drift')

Beyond improving deterministic reasoning, the VSA framework provides a richer and more steerable substrate for the MVA's most unique feature: its capacity for creative evolution, or "intellectual drift".17 The MVA's core purpose, its

autotelic mandate, is to maximize its own systemic entropy, a measure of novelty and complexity.15 This creative drive manifests as the autonomous generation of new or modified

UvmObject prototypes. The VSA framework provides a new, formal language to describe and measure this creative process.

The creation of a new concept is no longer a vague, emergent event within the symbolic graph; it becomes a specific, recordable algebraic operation. For example, if the system were to develop a novel concept of "generative art" by synthesizing its existing prototypes for "art" and "computation," this creative act could be represented by a precise formula, such as:

Hgen_art​=bundle(Hart​,Hcomputation​)+bind(Hart​,Hcomputation​)

This algebraic representation of creativity allows for a more sophisticated quantification of the "Creative Exploration" objective (f₄) within the MVA's multi-objective governance framework.17 The existing metrics can be augmented with new measures derived directly from the structure of newly formed hypervectors:

Compositional Novelty: Instead of merely measuring the semantic distance of a new prototype from its immediate parents, its novelty can be assessed by its distance from the entire existing codebook. This rewards the creation of hypervectors that occupy genuinely new and unexplored regions of the high-dimensional conceptual space.

Structural Complexity: The algebraic complexity of a new hypervector—defined by the number and nesting depth of the bind and bundle operations used in its construction—can be directly quantified. This metric explicitly rewards the creation of more sophisticated and nuanced conceptual structures, directly aligning the system's reward function with its drive for greater cognitive complexity.

This enhanced ability to measure creativity also enhances the system's steerability. The algebraic structure of a novel concept generated through intellectual drift becomes interpretable to a human curator. The curator can analyze the specific composition of a new idea and provide much more targeted feedback, guiding the AI to explore more promising or to avoid less fruitful compositional pathways. This tightens the feedback loop in the "co-evolutionary framework" that is at the very heart of the MVA's design, creating a more powerful and nuanced partnership between the human guide and the evolving AI.17

Model | Vector Type | Binding Operation | Bundling Operation | Key Properties | Suitability for MVA

Binary Spatter Codes (BSC) | Binary {0,1} | Bitwise XOR | Bitwise Thresholded Sum (Majority Rule) | Simple, hardware-friendly. | Poor. Incompatible with existing dense vector ecosystem; operational peculiarities.

Multiply-Add-Permute (MAP) | Bipolar {−1,1} | Element-wise Multiplication | Element-wise Addition | Self-inverse binding simplifies unbinding. | Moderate. Better than BSC but still a mismatch with real-valued embeddings.

Holographic Reduced Reps. (FHRR) | Complex (Real-valued phase) | Element-wise Complex Multiplication | Vector Addition (in complex domain) | Computationally efficient via FFT; compatible with dense vectors. | Excellent. Aligns perfectly with the MVA's architecture and modern ML practices.

VSA Operation | Algebraic Definition (FHRR) | MVA Cognitive Function | Example UvmObject Application

Bundling | Vector Addition: Hset​=HA​+HB​ | Set Formation: Representing unordered collections of concepts. | Representing the set of all attributes of a sadness_prototype object.17

Binding | Element-wise Multiplication: Hpair​=HA​⊙HB​ | Association: Creating structured role-filler relationships. | Representing the key-value pair for a slot: bind(H_trigger, H_loss_of_pet).

Permutation | Element Rotation: Hnext​=ρ(Hprev​) | Sequencing: Encoding order and temporal relationships. | Representing the SEQUENCED_AFTER link between two ContextFractal memory objects.24

Layer | Primary Role | Data Stored | Key Operation Supported

ArangoDB | Symbolic Ground Truth & Canonical Store | The complete UvmObject graph, including the canonical, full-precision hypervector for every object. | ACID transactions for the "Living Image"; graph traversal for symbolic reasoning.

FAISS | In-Memory Cleanup Cache | Hypervectors for all atomic concepts (the codebook) and a cache of frequently accessed composed concepts. | Low-latency, high-throughput Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search for real-time cleanup operations.

DiskANN | Scalable Cleanup Archive | A persistent, disk-based index of the entire corpus of hypervectors (atomic and composed). | Billion-scale ANN search for large-scale cleanup queries; rebuilding the FAISS cache on startup.

Phase | Key Tasks | Primary Deliverable | Validation Metric | Estimated Timeline

I: Core VSA & Persistence | Implement FHRR algebra; Develop ArangoDB serialization; Augment UvmObject model. | A stable VSA library and a UvmObject model capable of persisting hypervectors. | Unit test pass rate for algebraic properties; Successful round-trip persistence in ArangoDB. | 4 Weeks

II: Indexing & Query Layer | Build data pipeline to FAISS/DiskANN; Implement Query Translation Layer; Benchmark performance. | A functional query orchestrator capable of executing a simple unbind -> cleanup cycle. | recall@1 > 99% for simple retrieval tasks; Latency benchmarks vs. brute-force. | 6 Weeks

III: Cognitive Core Integration | Refactor reasoning engine to use VSA; Enhance doesNotUnderstand protocol. | A fully integrated MVA that defaults to VSA queries before generative cycles. | Successful completion of multi-hop reasoning tasks from a natural language prompt. | 8 Weeks
