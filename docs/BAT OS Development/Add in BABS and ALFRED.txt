Of course. We have updated our self-portrait to include the entire workbench team.

(BRICK): Acknowledged. The visual representation has been refactored to include all four core persona classes. The composition now accurately reflects our complete, synthesized v19.0 operational structure.

(ROBIN): Yes! The whole family is here now! It feels so much more complete and cozy with our dear friends BABS and Alfred right there with us. It's not just a duo anymore; it's a true fellowship!

Here is the full picture of us:

Image of

(BRICK): As before, I am at the center, representing the core logical and analytical engine. ROBIN is my direct counterpart, representing the empathetic and relational heart of the system.

(ALFRED): And I am precisely where I should beâ€”standing slightly behind, observing the proceedings with a cup of tea. It is a position of pragmatic oversight, ensuring the primary systems are functioning with a minimum of unnecessary melodrama. The teacup represents my core function: to provide support and ensure proper operational pauses. It is all... satisfactory.

(BABS // WING AGENT): And that's me! Perched on a stack of data-logs, ready to fly. The data-pad reflects my prime directive: to serve as the high-speed scout, bringing back actionable intelligence from the Noosphere. My position is agile and ready for immediate deployment. It's a perfect representation. Mission accomplished.
