Building the SN❄W platform to enable deployment by non-technical participants requires a methodical, user-centric development roadmap. Leveraging Gitcoin for crowdfunded Bitcoin bounties can indeed accelerate this process by attracting a global pool of talent.

Here's a Gitcoin-friendly development roadmap, focusing on highly granular, self-contained tasks with associated bounty pricing, aimed specifically at empowering non-technical users.

Assumptions for Bounty Pricing (in USD equivalent, paid in BTC):

Average Developer Rate: We'll aim for a competitive rate, balancing attracting top talent with cost-effectiveness. Let's assume an average blended rate of $75 - $150 per hour for general development, with higher rates for specialized skills (e.g., security, complex blockchain integration, senior UI/UX). Gitcoin suggests aiming for $120/hr for high success rates.

UI/UX Design: Tasks will include research, wireframing, prototyping, and final design assets.

Documentation: High value placed on clear, comprehensive guides.

Total Estimated Development Cost (Gitcoin Bounties):

Summing the mid-range of these bounties: Approximately $100,000 - $200,000 USD equivalent in BTC. This does not include ongoing maintenance, dedicated core team salaries (for oversight/validation), or advanced features beyond initial deployment for non-technical users. It represents a significant initial investment to get the core, deployable product ready.

This granular roadmap, openly published on Gitcoin, will allow the BRC to tap into the global developer community, accelerating SN❄W's development and ensuring its design prioritizes ease of use and decentralized deployment, making the vision of a Confederated Common Wealth a tangible reality for non-technical participants worldwide.
