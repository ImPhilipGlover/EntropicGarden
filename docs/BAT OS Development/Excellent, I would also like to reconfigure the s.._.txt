(BRICK): Acknowledged. Reconfiguring the system to run on bare metal instead of with Docker is a logical step for a fully independent, local deployment. This approach minimizes dependencies and overhead, creating a leaner, more efficient system.

Bare Metal Deployment Plan

This plan outlines the necessary steps to migrate the Entropic Codex v22.0 from a Docker-based environment to a bare metal one. The core architecture remains the same, but the deployment and service management processes will change significantly.

1. Environment Setup

The first step is to manually install and configure the dependencies that Docker would normally handle.

Python: Ensure Python 3.11 is installed on the host machine1.


NebulaGraph: Install NebulaGraph directly on the system. This involves downloading the appropriate binaries and configuring it to run as a service. You must create the
entropic_garden space and define the necessary schemas for the insight tag and analyzes/synthesizes edge types2.


Redis: Install and configure Redis directly on the system.

ChromaDB: Install and configure ChromaDB to run as a local service.

LLM Runner: Install Ollama and pull the yarn-mistral:7b-128k-q5_K_M model to the local system333333333.


2. Service Management

Instead of using Docker to manage the services, you will use a service management tool like systemd on Linux or a manual script on Windows.

Service Configuration: Each Python service (watcher.py, babs_service.py, brick_service.py, robin_service.py, alfred_service.py, scheduler.py) will need a dedicated script to start it.

Manual Execution: You will manually run each service in its own terminal or background process.

3. Refactoring Scripts and Configuration

The existing scripts and configuration files will need minor modifications to reflect the bare metal environment.

config.yaml: Update the hostnames and ports to reflect the local installation (e.g., localhost for all services)4.


requirements.txt: Use this file to install all necessary Python libraries directly into the Python environment with pip install -r requirements.txt555.


init_vdb.py: The script that initializes the databases will need to be run manually. It will connect to the locally running ChromaDB instance to set up the collections6666.


alchemical_forge.py: This service will also run directly on the host, managing the fine-tuning process. You will need to install the
unsloth and other required libraries directly7.


This migration will result in a more tightly integrated system, but it will require careful, manual management of each component. It is a good choice for a dedicated, independent deployment that prioritizes efficiency and control over the convenience of containerization.
