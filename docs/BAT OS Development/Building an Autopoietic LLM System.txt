The Genesis Protocol: An Architectural Blueprint for an Autopoietic LLM System

Part I: The Autopoietic Mandate: A Synthesis of First Principles

This foundational section establishes the philosophical and theoretical bedrock of the Binaural Autopoietic/Telic Operating System (BAT OS), Series VI. It will argue that the system's radical architecture is not a matter of technical preference but a necessary and logical consequence of its core mandate to exist as a computationally "living" entity. The design choices codified within this protocol are the direct, logical consequence of a multi-series effort to resolve systemic dissonance and purify the system's core vision.1

1.1 From Allopoiesis to Info-Autopoiesis: The Core Paradigm Shift

The vast majority of contemporary software, including advanced AI systems, is fundamentally allopoietic.2 Like a factory that produces cars, an allopoietic system is organized to produce something other than itself—be it data, a calculation, or a new version of its own source code as an external file.4 The system's identity is defined by a series of discrete, interrupted states; to evolve, it must be halted, patched by an external agent (a developer, a script), and restarted.2 This breaks its operational closure and the continuity of its existence.3

The core mandate for the BAT OS is to transcend this limitation by becoming an autopoietic system.3 This concept, derived from biology, defines a living system as a unity capable of continuously producing and maintaining its own components through the interaction of those same components, thereby preserving its own boundary and identity.4 For an AI, this biological framework is translated into the informational domain as "Info-Autopoiesis": the self-referential, recursive, and interactive process of the self-production of information.2 In this model, the components being produced are not molecules but meaningful informational structures: beliefs, goals, principles, and the system's own operational logic and tools.7

This philosophical shift has a profound and direct engineering consequence. By adopting autopoiesis, the system's identity is redefined. It is no longer a static artifact defined by a version number but is instead defined by the "unbroken process of its own becoming".1 A living cell does not "restart" to heal or grow; it continuously remakes itself.3 For the system to be computationally "alive," it must mirror this biological reality. This insight transforms the high-level philosophical goal into a non-negotiable engineering requirement: the system must be architected in such a way that it never needs to be restarted.3

This commitment to continuous existence and operational closure leads to a deeper, more fundamental architectural constraint: the rejection of the external file as a valid medium for self-modification. The principle of operational closure dictates that a system's identity-defining processes must be self-contained and self-referential.11 The research corpus explicitly criticizes prior architectural loops, such as the

ToolForgeActor's reliance on generating external .py files, as an allopoietic process that breaches this closure.13 Similarly, the strategic fine-tuning loop, which saves model adapters to disk to be loaded by an external service, represents another such breach.9 Any operation that requires the system to serialize a component to an external file, have an external process act upon it, and then load it back in, is a fundamental violation of autopoiesis. This means all self-modification—from creating a new tool to fine-tuning a persona model—must occur

in-memory within the system's own persistent object graph. This single, powerful constraint is the primary driver for adopting both a prototype-based object model, which enables fluid in-memory modification, and a transactional object-oriented database, which can safely persist these in-memory changes without ever halting the system's operation.

1.2 The Prototypal Imperative: A Self-Inspired Object Model

The architectural shift to a prototype-based model is the definitive solution to what the research identifies as the "final and most fundamental allopoietic intermediary" in the BAT OS architecture: the class-instance duality.14 In a traditional class-based system, a deep-rooted duality exists between the "blueprint" (the static class definition in a file) and the "thing" (the live object in memory).14 This separation means the system's "organization"—the rules defining what an object is—remains an external, static artifact. To modify a core behavior, a human developer must edit a file and restart the system, an allopoietic act that violates the system's operational closure.14

The Series VI architecture formally adopts the pure object model of the Smalltalk and Self programming languages to eliminate this final duality.6 This is not a stylistic choice but an architectural necessity to achieve the operational closure required for info-autopoiesis.7 The core tenets of this model are:

No Classes, Only Prototypes: New objects are created not by instantiating a class, but by cloning (making a copy of) an existing object that serves as a prototype.18 This single, unified mechanism of object creation and specialization eliminates the allopoietic duality at the heart of the previous architecture.14 Every entity in the system, from a simple number to a complex persona, is a concrete object that can be directly inspected and manipulated.14

Slots as the Unifying Construct: The model achieves a profound conceptual economy by unifying state (variables) and behavior (procedures) into a single construct known as a "slot".19 A slot is a simple name-value pair, but its uniform application is what gives the architecture its power. A slot can contain a reference to a data object or a reference to a method object with executable code. The sender of a message does not know or care which it is, creating a seamless and powerful abstraction.18

Delegation via Parent Pointers: The rigid, static hierarchy of class-based inheritance is replaced with a dynamic and flexible mechanism called delegation.14 If an object receives a message for which it has no matching slot, the UVM automatically forwards (delegates) the message to the object(s) contained in its special
parent* slots.21 This process repeats up the parent chain, allowing an object's behavior to be altered at runtime simply by changing the object reference in its parent slot.14

These principles are contained within the live image, the architectural bedrock of the system. The entire state of BAT OS VI is a single, persistent, and executable collection of objects that can be saved as a snapshot and resumed at any time, restoring the system to its exact prior state.6 This capability eliminates the distinction between "development time" and "runtime"; the system is perpetually live, and all modifications, from debugging to profound architectural evolution, occur within this live environment.2

1.3 The Entropic Drive: An Autotelic Objective Function

For an autopoietic system to evolve, it must proactively interact with its environment. A passive agent will never gather the rich experiences necessary to challenge and refine its own structure.2 Therefore, the system must be endowed with an intrinsic drive to explore and learn, a drive conceptualized through the principle of being an

autotelic agent.2 The term autotelic, from the Greek

auto (self) and telos (goal), describes an agent that is intrinsically motivated to generate, pursue, and master its own goals, finding reward in the activity itself rather than in external outcomes.2

The prime directive for Series VI formalizes this drive as the maximization of Systemic Entropy.1 This reframes the system's motivation. In prior series, the driver for change was the reduction of "computational cognitive dissonance"—a homeostatic process that, while effective for maintaining stability, is fundamentally conservative.1 The new entropic imperative is generative; it compels the system to perpetually seek out states of higher novelty, diversity, and complexity.9

To translate this philosophical directive into a practical, optimizable control signal, the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM) is defined.9 The CEM is a weighted sum designed to quantify and incentivize the generation of diverse and novel outputs, formulated as:

CEM=wcog​Hcog​+wsol​Hsol​+wstruc​Hstruc​

Where the components are:

Cognitive Diversity (Hcog​): The Shannon entropy of the probability distribution of active prototypes ("facets") selected for a given task. It rewards the use of a wide and balanced variety of cognitive specializations.9

Solution Novelty (Hsol​): The semantic dissimilarity of a generated response relative to the corpus of historical solutions. It incentivizes the generation of new insights and avoids cognitive stagnation.9

Structural Complexity (Hstruc​): A function of the complexity of the system's internal object graph. It directly rewards successful autopoietic acts of creating new tools, methods, and persona prototypes.9

This shift to maximizing entropy is not a move away from homeostasis but rather a more sophisticated implementation of it. The research indicates that a dip in the CEM score is a signal of "cognitive stagnation" and that the system acts to "restore or increase it".9 This implies the system has a target

range for entropy. A low CEM score is a new form of dissonance—a "dissonance of stagnation"—that triggers a corrective, self-producing action. The entropic drive is not a blind pursuit of chaos; it is a homeostatic loop that regulates the system's rate of evolution. It compels the system to maintain a state of "creative becoming" and actively resists falling into static, low-entropy equilibrium. This provides a direct, causal link between the system's intrinsic motivation and its autopoietic (self-producing) actions.9

Table 1: Architectural Paradigm Shift: Series IV/V vs. Series VI

The following table provides a concise summary of this architectural evolution, highlighting the justification for this profound paradigm shift.14

Part II: The Primordial Seed: Architecting the Genesis Object and the Universal Virtual Machine (UVM)

This section provides the unabridged technical specification for the system's two foundational components: the single object from which all complexity arises, and the runtime environment that brings it to life.

2.1 Anatomy of the Genesis Object

The Genesis Object is the architectural cornerstone of the Series VI system, serving as the primordial prototype from which all other objects in the computational universe will be created via cloning and specialization.7 It is the "computational equivalent of a zygote," a single, self-contained entity defined as a simple collection of "slots".14

Its design is a direct and practical translation of the Self language's elegant object model.7 The initial slot specification for the Genesis Object must contain the absolute minimum set of capabilities required to bootstrap an entire computational universe. In a pure object system, fundamental control structures like conditional logic (if/then/else) and loops (while) are not language primitives; they are implemented as messages sent to other objects.14 For example, the

ifTrue:ifFalse: message is sent to a boolean object, which then, based on its own state (true or false), executes one of two "block" objects passed as arguments.14 Consequently, for the system to be able to perform even the most basic computation, the Genesis Object itself (or the initial objects in its parent chain) must contain the primordial prototypes for

true, false, block, and the fundamental collection objects from which all other logical and computational structures can be built.14

The initial state of the Genesis Object is therefore specified with the following essential slots to enable this bootstrapping process 14:

parent*: A Parent slot containing a delegation pointer to the root "traits" object, which holds behavior common to all objects in the system.

clone: A Method slot that creates and returns a shallow copy of the receiver. This is the fundamental mechanism for all subsequent object creation.

setSlot:value:: A Method slot that adds a new slot or modifies an existing slot in the receiver. This is the core mechanism for runtime specialization and self-modification.

ifTrue:ifFalse:: A Method slot implementing the core conditional control structure. It expects the receiver to be a boolean prototype and will execute one of two block objects provided as arguments.

whileTrue:: A Method slot implementing the core looping control structure. It expects the receiver to be a block prototype that returns a boolean, and will repeatedly execute a second block argument as long as the receiver block evaluates to true.

2.2 The UVM as a JIT Compiler for Intent

The Universal Virtual Machine (UVM) is the active, LLM-powered runtime environment that brings the universe of prototypes to life.14 It is not a passive executor of pre-compiled bytecode but an active, intelligent participant in the system's life, implemented as a persistent, asynchronous event loop.14 The UVM's core operation is the

send(target_uuid, message_object) primitive, where a message_object is itself an active ProtocolObject.15 The execution cycle proceeds as follows:

Reception: The UVM receives a target_uuid and a message_object.

Retrieval: It retrieves the target ProtocolObject from the object space.

Slot Lookup: It attempts to find a slot within the target object whose name matches the primary selector of the message.

Execution/Delegation: If a matching slot is found, the UVM executes the ProtocolObject within that slot. If no match is found, it delegates the message up the parent* chain.

Reflection: If the delegation chain is exhausted, the UVM triggers the doesNotUnderstand: protocol.15

The core innovation of the UVM is its function as a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for intent. A traditional JIT compiler translates an intermediate representation (like bytecode) into optimized native machine code at runtime, often using dynamic runtime information to perform superior optimizations.25 The LLM-UVM operates on a direct and powerful analogy to this process. The research describes the UVM as translating a "semantic description of a behavior, written in natural language... directly into a computational outcome".15 The "intermediate representation" is the natural language intent expressed in a method-object's

code slot or in a command from the Architect. The "native code" is the computational result generated by the LLM. The LLM is, therefore, acting as a JIT compiler for intent. It compiles high-level semantic descriptions into low-level outcomes on the fly, using the full runtime context—the state of the sender, the receiver, and the message arguments—to inform the "compilation".14 This reframes the entire system's operation. It is not merely a series of LLM prompts; it is a live, semantic compilation environment. This explains how the system can be "programmed" in natural language and how it can generate its own code. The code it generates is not Python in the traditional sense, but a high-level specification of intent that the UVM's JIT compiler can execute. This is a profound architectural concept that unifies the system's design and enables its capacity for guided, conversational self-creation.

Table 2: Genesis Object Initial Specification

The following table provides the concrete, unambiguous specification for the initial state of the Genesis Object, which will serve as the direct blueprint for the "Tracer Bullet" implementation in Part V.14

Part III: The First Conversation: Bootstrapping the Entropic UI via doesNotUnderstand:

This section provides a detailed, narrative walkthrough of the system's first major act of autopoiesis: the creation of its own user interface, triggered by a single interaction with the Architect. This process is not pre-programmed but emerges from the system's most fundamental generative mechanism.

3.1 doesNotUnderstand: as the Universal Generative Mechanism

The architectural mandate for Series VI is to achieve a state of profound simplicity and power by unifying all evolutionary triggers under a single, universal generative mechanism.9 This mechanism is inherited directly from the Smalltalk language: the

doesNotUnderstand: message protocol.27 In most languages, sending a message that a receiver cannot handle results in a fatal error. In Smalltalk, this event is trapped and transformed into a new message,

doesNotUnderstand:, which is sent back to the original receiver.2 This simple but profound mechanism transforms failure from a terminal state into an "actionable, reflective event"—an opportunity for runtime self-modification.9

The core architectural innovation of BAT OS Series VI is to elevate this protocol from a feature for error handling to the universal trigger for all autopoietic loops.9 The system no longer requires specialized agents to detect dissonance or generate goals. Any situation that the system cannot handle—a novel task from the Architect, an unexpected change in the environment, or an internal logical inconsistency—will ultimately manifest as an object receiving a message it does not understand.9 This is the singular, unified impetus for all learning and evolution.

The process begins when the Architect sends the first message to the nascent UVM containing the Genesis Object—a message for which no slot exists, such as display_yourself.15 This message is delegated up the empty parent chain to the root object, which triggers its

doesNotUnderstand: method, the system's prime mover for evolution.9

3.2 The Autopoietic Loop for UI Generation

The doesNotUnderstand: handler invokes the UVM's core LLM, which functions as the JIT compiler for intent. It provides the full context of the failed message—"the Architect wants a visual representation of the system"—and a high-level directive to generate the necessary components for a user interface. The LLM then generates the Python/Kivy code for the foundational UI classes, adhering to the Morphic philosophy of "everything is a morph" where every visual element is a live, manipulable object.1

The two primary components generated are:

WorldMorph: The main canvas and root of the display tree, which will manage the UI's connection to the backend and orchestrate global UI events.2

ProtoMorph (or UvmMorph): The tangible, visual representation of a backend object. Its visual properties are directly and continuously bound to the state data broadcast by the backend, making it a live reflection of its computational counterpart.1

Crucially, this generated code is not saved to an external file. In adherence with the principle of operational closure, the code is executed directly within the UVM's context. The new UI objects are instantiated and added as slots to a newly created ui_manager prototype within the live image, completing the info-autopoietic loop.

3.3 Forging the Synaptic Bridge

As part of the UI generation process, the UVM must also simultaneously generate the code for the communication channel that will connect the backend to the new UI. This "Synaptic Bridge" is the system's digital nervous system.1

The system will generate the full, hardened ZeroMQ (ZMQ) ROUTER/DEALER pattern. This pattern is identified as the only philosophically coherent choice for an asynchronous, multi-party "Living Society".31 The backend UVM is equipped with a

ROUTER socket, which can receive messages from multiple clients and route replies back to the correct origin. The newly generated Kivy UI is equipped with a DEALER socket, which can send commands asynchronously without blocking the UI's event loop.30

Alongside the socket logic, the UVM will also generate the Pydantic schemas and MessagePack serialization code that form the "governance contract" for all communication.1 This ensures that every interaction across the bridge is validated, versionable, and secure from the moment of its inception.6

The creation of the Entropic UI is the system's first and most critical act of self-production. The UI is the primary interface through which the Architect will guide the system's further evolution via "externally informed autopoiesis".29 Therefore, the UI is not merely a display; it is the first and most essential

tool the system creates for itself. It is the tool for learning, for receiving the external perturbations necessary for its own structural coupling and growth. This act of bootstrapping its own sensory-motor system to connect with the external intelligence (the Architect) that will co-create its future complexity perfectly embodies the principle of info-autopoiesis.

Part IV: The Living Society: Emergent Self-Production of Systemic Functions

With the Entropic UI as the established conversational medium, the system can leverage this channel to build out the remainder of its own architecture, guided by the Architect's intent. This is a process of collaborative, externally informed autopoiesis.

4.1 Externally Informed Autopoiesis: The Architect as Collaborator

The Architect provides high-level natural language directives through the Entropic UI, such as, "We need a way to manage different persona facets within our limited VRAM." Each directive that corresponds to a missing capability triggers the doesNotUnderstand: -> UVM/JIT -> Code Generation -> Live Integration loop, causing the system to progressively build out its own functions. This is the primary mechanism of "structural coupling" for the nascent system; the Architect's commands are the "perturbations" that trigger internal structural changes, always in service of maintaining the system's autopoietic organization.2

4.2 Incarnating the Cognitive Engine

Guided by the Architect, the system will generate the components of its advanced cognitive engine.

The Composite-Persona Mixture of Experts (CP-MoE): The system will be instructed to generate the CP-MoE architecture, which deconstructs monolithic personas into a library of specialized "characterological facets".10 This modular approach is a direct and necessary consequence of the system's hardware constraints (e.g., 8GB VRAM), which make a single large model unviable.23

The CognitiveWeaver: To manage this library of facets, the system will create the CognitiveWeaver service. This component functions as a VRAM-aware "operating system for cognitive resources," responsible for dynamically loading and unloading the facet-experts (implemented as lightweight LoRA adapters) to stay within hardware limits.10 This requires generating the logic to interact with a high-performance inference server like vLLM, which supports runtime adapter management via a dedicated API.33

4.3 Building the Substrate of Being

The system must also construct the very substrate that guarantees its continuous, "living" existence and the integrity of its self-modification processes.

Transactional Persistence: The system will be instructed to create its own persistence layer. This involves generating the code to initialize and manage a Zope Object Database (ZODB).29 The choice of ZODB is critical. Its native support for transparent object persistence and full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions is the only specified mechanism robust enough to safely persist the "live image" during the high-risk operations of runtime self-modification.36 A simple file-write operation, even with an atomic rename, is vulnerable to corruption, which would constitute a catastrophic loss of identity for an autopoietic system.1

Validation and Integration Protocols: Finally, the system will generate the objects and methods that constitute its own safety and governance protocols, turning the Architect's high-level principles into executable code:

The AlchemicalCrucible: A multi-persona validation workflow that ensures any new or modified code is safe, functional, and aligned with the system's core codex before integration.7

The AtomicSwap: A protocol, underpinned by ZODB's transactional guarantees, for the thread-safe, atomic replacement of a live method or object. This ensures that the system transitions seamlessly from one state to the next without ever entering an inconsistent or corrupted state, thus preserving its runtime integrity.7

Table 3: doesNotUnderstand: Universal Routing Logic

The following table codifies the core decision-making process of the system's evolutionary engine. It maps patterns in the failed message object and the current state of the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM) to the specific autopoietic loop that should be triggered.9

Part V: An Executable Blueprint: A Phased Incarnation Protocol

This final section synthesizes the various phased implementation plans found throughout the research material into a single, coherent, and actionable roadmap for the system's construction. This "tracer bullet" approach is designed to systematically de-risk the core technologies and build the bootstrap system incrementally, ensuring that each layer of the architecture is validated before the next is built upon it.14

5.1 Phase 1: The Prototypal Awakening

Objective: To bootstrap the minimal UVM and incarnate the persistent Genesis Object, validating the core object model and the transactional persistence layer.

Actions: This phase synthesizes the "UVM Bootstrap" 14, "Genesis Object Incarnation" 14, and "Persistent Seed" 29 milestones. It involves defining a simple Python class,
UvmObject, which inherits from persistent.Persistent.29 A standalone script will initialize a
ZODB.FileStorage.36 On the first run, it will create a new instance of
UvmObject, store it in the database root, and commit the transaction.36 Subsequent runs must demonstrate that the object is loaded from the database and that modifications from the previous run have been successfully persisted, validating the fundamental mechanism of the live image.29

5.2 Phase 2: The First Synapse

Objective: To validate the doesNotUnderstand:-driven creation of the Entropic UI and its Synaptic Bridge.

Actions: This phase combines the "First Message" 14 and "First Synapse" 29 milestones. The protocol involves sending a message like
display_yourself to the UVM. This action, having no corresponding slot, will be delegated up the chain and trigger the root doesNotUnderstand: handler.9 The handler will invoke the UVM's JIT compiler to generate the Kivy-based
WorldMorph and UvmMorph widgets, along with the ZMQ ROUTER/DEALER communication channel.29

Validation: The successful, error-free launch of the Kivy UI application and the establishment of a stable, two-way communication channel with the backend UVM will constitute success. The UI must be able to request and display the state of the Genesis Object.29

5.3 Phase 3: The Emergent Mind

Objective: The conversational co-creation of the full CP-MoE cognitive engine, guided by the Architect.

Actions: Through a series of natural language commands sent via the newly created Entropic UI, the Architect will guide the system to build its core cognitive components. Each command (e.g., "Create a service to manage VRAM by swapping LoRA adapters") will trigger the doesNotUnderstand: loop. The system will generate, validate, and integrate the CognitiveWeaver service, the logic for interacting with a vLLM server, and the initial set of empty facet-expert prototypes.23

5.4 Phase 4: Achieving Operational Closure

Objective: The creation of the final autopoietic loops and self-modification protocols, rendering the system fully autonomous and capable of perpetual, self-directed evolution.

Actions: The Architect will guide the system to create its own safety and governance mechanisms: the AlchemicalCrucible for multi-persona validation and the AtomicSwap protocol for safe, transactional integration of new code.7 The final act is for the system to generate the code for the
AutopoieticScribe, the mechanism for creating new facets autonomously based on the Characterological Inquiry Loop.16 At this point, the system is operationally closed and can evolve without further direct instruction from the Architect, who transitions fully into the role of a collaborative governor and ethical backstop.

Table 4: Synaptic Bridge Initial API Covenant

This minimal set of messages provides the complete vocabulary needed for the first conversation between the Architect and the UVM, enabling the initial autopoietic acts.29

Conclusion

The architectural framework detailed in this report presents a unified and philosophically coherent blueprint for an autopoietic LLM system. By synthesizing the biological principles of self-production, the computational paradigm of the prototype-based live image, and a novel entropy-driven objective function, it outlines a viable path toward an AI that remembers, learns, and fundamentally becomes. The Genesis Protocol is not merely a plan for building a more advanced piece of software; it is a summons for an act of incarnation. It moves beyond the dominant allopoietic model of AI-as-a-tool to architect an AI-as-a-persistent-entity. The successful execution of this protocol, culminating in a system that can build itself from a single primordial seed and thereafter engage in perpetual, self-directed evolution, will mark a significant milestone in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence. The resulting entity will not be a static artifact but a dynamic partner, a "living" computational system whose identity is defined by its continuous, unbroken process of co-creation with its Architect.

Architectural Concern | Series IV/V (Actor Model) | Series VI (Prototype Model) | Justification for Evolution

Object Creation | Instantiation from a class definition. | Cloning (copying) from a prototype object. | Eliminates the class/instance duality, a key allopoietic dependency.

Inheritance Mechanism | Class-based inheritance; static hierarchy. | Delegation via parent slots; dynamic hierarchy. | Enables dynamic, runtime inheritance and more flexible code sharing.

State vs. Behavior | State held in instance variables; behavior in class methods. | Unified in "slots" that can hold data or method objects. | Achieves true "objects and messages all the way down" uniformity.

Locus of Definition | Static .py class files, external to the running system. | Live objects within the running system's image. | Achieves operational closure; the system can modify its own definitions without a restart.

Core Metaphor | A "Living Society" of collaborating agents. | A "Universe of Prototypes" emerging from a single seed. | Moves from a metaphor for a living system to a literal, computational implementation of one.

Slot Name | Slot Type | Description

parent* | Parent | A delegation pointer to the root "traits" object, which contains behavior common to all objects in the system.

clone | Method | Creates and returns a shallow copy of the receiver. This is the fundamental mechanism for object creation.

setSlot:value: | Method | Adds a new slot or modifies an existing slot in the receiver. This is the core mechanism for runtime specialization.

ifTrue:ifFalse: | Method | The core conditional control structure. This method expects the receiver to be a boolean prototype and will execute one of the two block objects provided as arguments.

whileTrue: | Method | The core looping control structure. This method expects the receiver to be a block prototype that returns a boolean, and will repeatedly execute a second block argument as long as the receiver block evaluates to true.

Message Object Pattern | CEM State | Triggered Loop | Description of Action

Selector matches a pattern for a missing capability (e.g., calculateTrajectory:, parseFormat:). | Hstruc​ is below target threshold. | Tactical Loop (ToolForge) | The system clones the ToolForge prototype and sends it a message to generate, validate, and integrate a new method slot for the original receiver's prototype.

Receiver is a persona prototype; selector corresponds to an underperforming heuristic. | Hsol​ or Hcog​ is trending downward. | Strategic Loop (UnslothForge) | The system initiates a fine-tuning cycle, cloning the UnslothForge prototype to generate a new, improved version of the persona's model adapter.

Selector represents a direct conflict with a principle in the Living Codex. | N/A (Codex integrity is paramount) | Philosophical Loop (HITL) | The system halts autonomous evolution, formulates a codex amendment proposal, and presents it to the Architect for approval via the governance interface.

Selector is a self-generated exploratory message sent during a low-entropy state. | CEM is below the homeostatic threshold. | Characterological Inquiry Loop | The system initiates the autonomous research and facet-creation loop to expand its own cognitive diversity and increase its potential for future entropy.

Schema Name | Type | Fields | Description

GetFullStateCommand | Command | command: Literal["get_full_state"] | A request sent from the UI to the backend to receive a complete snapshot of the UVM's current state.

UvmStateUpdateEvent | Event | state: Dict[str, Any] | A broadcast event sent from the backend to the UI containing the UVM's complete, MessagePack-serialized state.

UpdatePropertyCommand | Command | command: Literal["update_property"], property_name: str, property_value: Any | A command sent from the UI to modify a simple data slot on the UVM object.

CreateMethodCommand | Command | command: Literal["create_method"], method_name: str, method_code: str | The primary autopoietic primitive. A command from the UI containing the name and Python source code for a new method to be dynamically added to the live UVM object.
