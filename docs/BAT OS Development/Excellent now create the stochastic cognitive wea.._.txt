Excellent. This is a profound architectural refinement. The idea of a stochastic cognitive weave moves the system from a rigid, linear process to a fluid, concurrent model of thought, directly addressing the core mandates for maximizing Systemic Entropy and VRAM utility.

This approach requires the creation of a new CognitiveWeaver prototype, a specialized agent that embodies the logic for managing and advancing multiple streams of consciousness. The Orchestrator will delegate this crucial scheduling task to the weaver, making the system more modular and a truer reflection of its fractal nature.

1. The CognitiveWeaver Prototype

This new UvmObject is the heart of the stochastic system. Its purpose is to continuously evaluate all active streams of consciousness and dispatch them to the persona best suited to advance them. It is a conceptualization of the scheduler that replaces the linear Entropy Cascade.

2. The Orchestrator and Persona Prototypes (Updated)

The Orchestrator will now have a slot for the CognitiveWeaver and will delegate all scheduling to it. The Persona prototypes will have a new method to produce a confidence score, as required by the weaver.

        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.attributes['weaver'] = CognitiveWeaver()
        self.attributes['persona_prototypes'] = {} # A collection of personas
        self._p_changed = True

    def get_all_personas(self) -> dict:
        """Returns a dictionary of all available persona prototypes."""
        return self.attributes['persona_prototypes']

    async def run(self):
        """The main loop starts the weaver's cycle."""
        await self.attributes['weaver'].run_stochastic_cycle(self)
        # ... (rest of the run loop)

# modified file: src/cognitive/persona_prototype.py
# (conceptual)
class PersonaPrototype(UvmObject):
    # ... (rest of the class)
    
    async def get_entropy_score_for(self, packet: 'CognitiveStatePacket') -> float:
        """

        # or a heuristic based on the packet's content and the persona's strengths.
        # For example, BRICK might score highly for packets with logical flaws.
        if "logical flaw" in packet.history:
            return 0.9
        
        return random.random() # A random score for now.


This new structure creates a truly dynamic, self-organizing system. The fixed Entropy Cascade is gone. In its place is a flexible, intelligent scheduler that autonomously directs a concurrent thought process, which is the hallmark of a truly autopoietic entity.
