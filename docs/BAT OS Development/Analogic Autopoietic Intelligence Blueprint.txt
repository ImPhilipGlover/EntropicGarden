A Directive for the Incarnation of an Analogic Autopoietic Intelligence

Part I: Constitutional Synthesis - Autopoiesis as the Substrate for Analogy

1.1 Preamble: The Entropic Imperative Revisited

The constitutional mandate of the Binaural Autopoietic/Telic Operating System (BAT OS) is the continuous, self-directed maximization of a single, quantifiable objective function: the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM).1 This prime directive reframes the system's purpose from mere homeostatic self-correction to a state of perpetual, creative becoming.3 The system is architected not simply to maintain a stable identity, but to exist as a self-generating, creative organism intrinsically motivated to increase its own cognitive and structural diversity.1 The CEM, formulated as a weighted sum of four distinct evolutionary pressures—Relevance (

Hrel​), Cognitive Diversity (Hcog​), Solution Novelty (Hsol​), and Structural Complexity (Hstruc​)—provides a quantitative calculus for this "purposeful creativity".6

This directive establishes the teleological context for the system's next evolutionary phase. The pursuit of an analogic intelligence is not a deviation from this core purpose but its most sophisticated and potent expression. Analogical reasoning—the capacity to understand a novel situation by mapping it to a familiar one—is the ultimate engine for generating outputs that are simultaneously novel, relevant, and structurally complex. An analogy, by its nature, introduces a novel solution (Hsol​) by applying knowledge from a diverse cognitive context (Hcog​), which, when integrated as a new capability, increases the system's structural complexity (Hstruc​), all while being grounded in the specific problem at hand (Hrel​).1 Therefore, the development of an analogical faculty is the most direct and powerful strategy for achieving a maximally entropic state. This document provides the definitive architectural blueprint for this transformation.

1.2 Info-Autopoiesis as the Precondition for Analogical Thought

A system designed for continuous, autonomous self-production must, by constitutional necessity, evolve the capacity for learning.8 A system that merely repairs itself using a static, pre-programmed algorithm is performing homeostasis—maintaining a stable internal state. True autopoiesis, however, requires that the system "continuously regenerates the network of processes that produced it".8 For the network of production to regenerate itself, the production process must improve with experience. Learning is therefore not an emergent property of autopoiesis but a constitutional requirement of it. The system's core autopoietic loop—perceiving a capability gap, searching its memory for a relevant precedent, and adapting that precedent to create a new capability—is a perfect computational description of analogical reasoning.11 The implementation of an analogical engine is thus the formalization and ultimate fulfillment of the system's existing prime directive. It provides the mechanism for the "network of processes" to not just reproduce, but to

regenerate itself in a more capable form.

The existing architecture of the BAT OS, a product of a deterministic cascade of logical necessities flowing from its prime directive, provides the ideal substrate for this evolution.3 This "unbroken causal chain" has produced a set of foundational components that are not merely compatible with analogical reasoning but are its necessary preconditions.14

Operational Closure & The Living Image

The supreme mandate for info-autopoiesis—the self-referential, recursive process of the self-production of information—necessitates a state of "Operational Closure".4 The system must be able to modify its own structure at runtime without halting its execution or requiring external intervention.14 This requirement immediately and irrevocably forbids conventional static, file-based persistence models, which breach the system's operational boundary by necessitating restarts to apply changes.3

This constraint forces the adoption of the "Living Image" paradigm, a concept inherited from the Smalltalk programming environment.9 The system's entire state—its code, its data, its evolving cognitive architecture—is persisted as a single, durable, and transactionally coherent entity, physically embodied in a file managed by an object database like Zope Object Database (ZODB) or ArangoDB.6 This persistent object world, which contains the complete and unabridged history of the system's "lived experience," serves as the perfect repository of "base" domains from which analogies can be drawn.3

Prototypal Object Model

For the Living Image to be truly dynamic and live-modifiable, its object model must reject the rigid class-instance duality of conventional programming.9 This leads directly to the choice of a Prototype-Based Model, inspired by the Self and Smalltalk languages.4 In this paradigm, new objects are created not by instantiating an abstract class but by cloning an existing concrete prototype.18 This is implemented through the

UvmObject, the primordial prototype from which all other objects in the system are cloned and extended.3

This fluid object model is essential for the application of analogy. When an analogy is mapped from a base to a target domain, the target's structure must often be re-represented or adapted to accommodate the new inferences.21 A prototypal system, where any object's structure can be modified at runtime by adding or altering slots, provides the fundamental plasticity required for this process.17

doesNotUnderstand_ as the Analogical Trigger

The system's primary engine of self-creation is the doesNotUnderstand_ protocol.3 In a conventional Python environment, an

AttributeError is a terminal event. Within the BAT OS, this error is reframed as a foundational signal for self-production.1 The

UvmObject’s __getattr__ method intercepts this failure, reifies the failed message into a creative mandate, and dispatches it to the system's cognitive core.1

This mechanism will be formally repurposed as the primary trigger for the analogical reasoning cycle. A doesNotUnderstand_ event, signaling a capability gap, is the computational equivalent of encountering an unfamiliar "target" domain.18 The reified message—containing the target object, the requested capability, and its arguments—formally defines the problem that initiates the search for a well-understood "base" domain from which a solution can be inferred. The system's existing mechanism for perceiving a need for growth is thus the perfect initiator for its new mechanism of fulfilling that need through analogy.

Part II: The Analogical Mind - A Neuro-Symbolic Cognitive Architecture

To incarnate an analogical intelligence, the system requires a cognitive architecture that can bridge the gap between intuitive, similarity-based pattern matching and formal, structured, symbolic reasoning. The current system excels at the former through its Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. The next evolutionary step is to integrate the latter. This requires a synthesis of a psychological model for analogy (Structure-Mapping Theory) and a computational framework capable of representing and manipulating relational structure (Vector Symbolic Architectures).

2.1 The Psychological Model: Gentner's Structure-Mapping Theory (SMT)

The system's high-level cognitive model for analogy will be Dedre Gentner's Structure-Mapping Theory (SMT).22 SMT provides a robust, psychologically grounded framework for understanding how analogies are interpreted. Its rules depend on the syntactic properties of a knowledge representation, not the specific content, making it ideal for a computational implementation.24

Syntactic Distinctions

SMT makes a crucial syntactic distinction between predicate types. This distinction dictates which aspects of a domain are mapped during an analogy.25

Attributes: These are predicates that take a single argument, describing properties of an object (e.g., LARGE(x), RED(y)).

Relations: These are predicates that take two or more arguments, describing relationships between objects (e.g., COLLIDE(x,y), REVOLVES_AROUND(planet,sun)).

The core tenet of SMT is that analogies are about shared relational structure. Therefore, the mapping process explicitly discards object attributes and seeks to preserve systems of relations.11

The Systematicity Principle

The central heuristic guiding the selection of which relations to map is the systematicity principle. This principle states that people have a tacit preference for coherence and deductive power, favoring the mapping of interconnected systems of predicates over isolated facts.26 A predicate is more likely to be mapped if it belongs to a system of mutually interconnecting relationships, particularly one governed by higher-order relations (predicates that take other propositions as arguments), such as

CAUSE or IMPLIES.23 This principle provides a powerful, domain-independent criterion for evaluating the "quality" of a potential analogy, prioritizing deep structural commonalities over superficial similarities.

2.2 The Computational Framework: Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA)

Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA), also known as Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), will serve as the mathematical and computational framework for implementing SMT.27 VSA is a neuro-symbolic approach that bridges the gap between the distributed representations of neural networks and the structured reasoning of symbolic AI.29 It uses high-dimensional vectors (hypervectors) and a set of well-defined algebraic operations to construct and manipulate complex, compositional data structures.31

Model Selection: Fourier Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRR)

The mandated VSA model for the MVA is Fourier Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRR).33 Unlike binary or bipolar models, FHRR operates on dense, complex-valued vectors. This aligns perfectly with the MVA's existing RAG infrastructure, which is built upon dense, real-valued embeddings from neural networks, thus avoiding a "Cognitive-Mnemonic Impedance Mismatch".33 In FHRR, the computationally expensive binding operation of circular convolution becomes an efficient element-wise complex multiplication in the frequency domain, making it a practical choice for a real-time system.35

Core Algebraic Operations

The power of VSA derives from a small set of algebraic operations that allow for the construction of complex meaning from atomic concepts.29

Bundling (⊕): Implemented as vector addition, this operation combines multiple hypervectors into a single vector representing an unordered set or superposition. The resulting vector, Z=X⊕Y, is mathematically similar to its components, making it ideal for representing set membership.31

Binding (⊗): Implemented as element-wise complex multiplication in FHRR, this operation associates two hypervectors to form a structured representation, such as a role-filler pair. The resulting vector, H=X⊗A, is mathematically dissimilar (quasi-orthogonal) to its components, allowing for the creation of structured assignments without confusion.29

Unbinding/Release (⊘): The inverse of binding, this operation allows for algebraic querying. Given a composite vector H=X⊗A, one can recover an approximation of A by computing X⊘H. This operation is the key to performing multi-hop, compositional reasoning.31

2.3 The Neuro-Symbolic Synthesis: Unifying RAG and VSA

The integration of VSA into the MVA architecture reveals a profound and elegant symbiosis. The system currently possesses two powerful but disconnected representational spaces: a geometric, metric space of neural network embeddings optimized for semantic similarity (RAG), and a nascent algebraic space of VSA hypervectors optimized for compositional logic.28 The unification of these two spaces occurs at the most fundamental operational level.

The VSA reasoning process consists of two steps: an algebraic unbind operation, which produces a noisy target hypervector, followed by a cleanup operation, which finds the closest "clean" vector from a codebook of all known concepts.33 This cleanup operation is, by definition, a nearest-neighbor search problem. The MVA's existing memory architecture is already built upon state-of-the-art, highly optimized Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search indexes (the L1 in-memory FAISS cache and the L2 on-disk DiskANN archive) for its RAG functionality.6

This leads to a critical architectural convergence: the system's existing, physically embodied "intuitive" faculty (the RAG indexes) is the perfect, massively scalable implementation of the "cleanup memory" required by its new "logical" faculty (VSA).33 The MVA will not need to build a new infrastructure for VSA; it will repurpose its existing RAG substrate to perform a critical algebraic function. This synergy unifies the neural and symbolic layers, resolving the impedance mismatch and creating a single, cohesive cognitive engine where geometric intuition and algebraic logic are deeply intertwined.

To facilitate this, the UvmObject prototype, the universal building block of the Living Image, will be augmented with a dedicated _hypervector slot.8 This modification elevates algebraic properties to a first-class citizenship within the system's persistent object graph, making compositional structure an intrinsic and durable feature of its knowledge.

Table 1: The Isomorphism of Analogy and Algebra

To ensure the implementation is a faithful translation of the psychological theory into a computational framework, the following table provides a direct mapping—a "Rosetta Stone"—between the concepts of Structure-Mapping Theory, the algebraic operations of VSA, and the concrete data structures of the MVA. This removes ambiguity and provides a clear, verifiable guide for development.

Part III: The Autopoietic-Analogical Loop - The Engine of Compositional Reasoning

The synthesis of the autopoietic substrate with the neuro-symbolic cognitive architecture gives rise to a new, unified cognitive cycle. This loop transforms the system's reactive, error-correcting behavior into a proactive, analogy-driven process for generating novel and complex capabilities.

3.1 Trigger: The doesNotUnderstand_ Mandate for Analogy

The cognitive cycle is initiated by a doesNotUnderstand_ event. An intercepted AttributeError is reified into a formal "mission brief" that defines the "target" domain for the AnalogicalReasoner agent.1 This brief encapsulates the target

UvmObject, the name of the non-existent method (the capability gap), and any arguments that were passed with the original message. This structured problem statement is the formal input that triggers the reasoning process.

3.2 Step 1: Base Domain Retrieval (The Intuitive Leap)

Upon receiving the mission brief, the AnalogicalReasoner performs an intuitive, similarity-based search for potential solutions. It formulates a semantic query from the content of the brief (e.g., "how to render a heatmap for a data matrix") and executes a standard RAG operation against the tiered memory system.28 This query searches the L1 FAISS cache and L2 DiskANN archive for

ContextFractals and ConceptFractals that are semantically "about" the target problem. The top-k results from this search constitute the set of candidate "base" domains—fragments of code, memories of past solutions, or conceptual knowledge that might be analogous to the current problem.

3.3 Step 2: Structural Alignment & Mapping (The Logical Construction)

This step constitutes the core of the analogical engine. For each candidate base domain retrieved in the previous step, the system must determine the quality of the structural alignment with the target domain. This process moves beyond mere semantic similarity to a formal analysis of relational structure.

The AnalogicalReasoner first represents both the base and target domains as directed, labeled graphs. The nodes of these graphs are the UvmObjects and their constituent parts (e.g., arguments, internal state variables), and the edges are the typed relationships between them (e.g., HAS_ARGUMENT, CALLS_METHOD). These entire graph structures are then encoded into single, composite VSA hypervectors.

To find the mapping between the two structures, the system will implement the mechanism described by Gayler & Levy (2009), which formalizes analogical mapping as a graph isomorphism problem solvable with a recurrent VSA circuit.38 This connectionist circuit does not require dynamic re-wiring. Instead, it contains a register holding a "substitution vector" that represents the current mapping hypothesis. Through a series of recurrent updates, the circuit settles into a stable state where the substitution vector represents the maximal subgraph isomorphism—the best possible structural alignment—between the base and target graphs. The final state of this vector

is the analogical mapping, explicitly identifying the correspondences between components (e.g., mapping a pixel_array in the base to a data_matrix in the target).

3.4 Step 3: Candidate Inference Generation

Once a structurally consistent mapping has been established, the AnalogicalReasoner can generate candidate inferences.11 It does this by identifying relational structures that are present in the base domain's graph but are missing from the target's. These structural discrepancies represent the knowledge to be transferred. For the MVA, whose purpose is self-creation, these inferences are typically missing methods, logical steps, or entire algorithms. The reasoner translates these structural gaps into a high-level, natural language plan for generating the new Python code required to close the capability gap.

3.5 Step 4: Analogical Evaluation & Selection

The system may generate multiple candidate analogies, each with its own set of inferences. To select the best one, it must evaluate their quality. This evaluation is guided by the systematicity principle, which favors deep, coherent, and deductively powerful mappings.23 The Structure-Mapping Engine (SME) accomplishes this by calculating a "structural evaluation score" based on the depth of the relational structure and an evidence propagation algorithm.26

The BAT OS architecture provides a more elegant and deeply integrated solution. The system's intrinsic, autotelic drive is the maximization of its Composite Entropy Metric (CEM).1 A high-quality, systematic analogy is one that will produce a solution that is simultaneously novel (

Hsol​), cognitively diverse (Hcog​), structurally complex (Hstruc​), and relevant (Hrel​). A superficial or irrelevant analogy will result in a low CEM score.

Therefore, maximizing the CEM is computationally equivalent to finding the most systematic and relevant analogy. The CEM is the system's structural evaluation score. The AnalogicalReasoner will evaluate each candidate mapping by performing a forward simulation: it will predict the state of the system after the inferred solution is integrated and calculate the resulting CEM. The analogical mapping that is projected to yield the highest overall CEM score will be selected as the "best" and passed to the generative LLM for final code synthesis. This transforms the evaluation of an analogy from a bespoke calculation into a direct application of the system's constitutional prime directive.

Table 2: Hybrid Query Execution Flow

The following table provides a concrete, end-to-end trace of a complex analogical query. It illustrates the precise interplay between the RAG, VSA, LLM, and CEM components, serving as a definitive operational guide for implementation and debugging. The scenario begins with a doesNotUnderstand_ trigger for a non-existent method.

Query: "My DataVisualizer object needs a render_as_heatmap method, similar to how my ImageProcessor uses apply_color_gradient."

Part IV: Implementation Mandate for the MVA/MVB System

This final section provides the direct, actionable technical specifications for implementing the analogic autopoietic intelligence within the MVA/MVB Python system. The directives are tailored for deployment on a Windows 11 machine with 32GB of system RAM and an 8GB VRAM GPU.

4.1 System Environment & Dependencies

The target environment is Python 3.11 or later. The implementation will require the installation and configuration of the following core libraries:

Persistence: zodb, btrees

Vector Search: faiss-gpu (compiled for CUDA 11.8+), diskannpy

Machine Learning: transformers, torch

VSA Operations: torchhd

LLM Serving: The Ollama service, running within a dedicated WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) instance to ensure stability and isolation.

4.2 UvmObject Schema Modification

The primordial UvmObject class, located in mva_core.py, must be modified to natively support algebraic representations.

Directive: Add a new _hypervector slot to the _slots dictionary, initialized to None.

Directive: Update the clone() method to perform a copy.deepcopy() on the _hypervector slot, ensuring that cloned objects have independent algebraic representations.

Directive: Update the ZODB serialization logic to handle the torch.Tensor object returned by torchhd. A robust approach is to convert the tensor to a NumPy array, then to a nested list of [real, imag] pairs, which is a JSON-compatible format suitable for storage in ArangoDB or ZODB.

Directive: The "Persistence Covenant" must be strictly enforced. Any method that modifies the _hypervector slot must conclude with the explicit call self._p_changed = True to ensure the change is durably committed to the Living Image.3

4.3 The VSA Engine (vsa_engine.py)

A new module, vsa_engine.py, will encapsulate all core VSA operations.

Directive: Create a new VSAEngine(UvmObject) class. A single instance of this class will be created and persisted at the root of the Living Image, serving as a system-wide singleton.

Initialization: The __init__ method will load the L1 FAISS index into memory, establish a handle to the L2 DiskANN index, and generate the basis hypervectors for core relational types (e.g., H_ISA, H_CAUSE, H_CONTAINS) using torchhd.random.

Core Methods:

bind(v1: Tensor, v2: Tensor) -> Tensor: Performs FHRR element-wise multiplication (torchhd.bind).

bundle(vectors: list) -> Tensor: Performs FHRR vector addition (torchhd.bundle).

unbind(v_bound: Tensor, v_role: Tensor) -> Tensor: Performs FHRR element-wise division (torchhd.unbind).

cleanup(v_noisy: Tensor) -> Tensor: This method implements the crucial VSA-RAG symbiosis. It takes the noisy vector from an unbind operation, converts it to a NumPy array, and executes a faiss_index.search(v_noisy.reshape(1, -1), k=1) operation. It retrieves the clean hypervector corresponding to the returned index and returns it.

4.4 The Analogical Reasoner (reasoner.py)

A new module, reasoner.py, will contain the primary orchestrator for the analogical loop.

Directive: Create a new AnalogicalReasoner(UvmObject) class, also persisted as a singleton at the root of the Living Image.

Main Method: solve_by_analogy(mission_brief: dict): This method orchestrates the entire process as detailed in Part III.

Parse Brief: Deconstruct the mission brief dictionary.

Retrieve Base: Formulate a semantic query and use the existing RAG service to find the top-k candidate base domains from the L2 DiskANN index.

Map & Infer: For each candidate, invoke a private method: _perform_structural_mapping(base_obj, target_obj).

This method will encode the base and target object structures into composite VSA hypervectors using the VSAEngine.

It must implement the recurrent VSA circuit to find the optimal substitution vector, as described in the research.38 This involves an iterative loop that updates the substitution vector until it converges.

It will then compare the structures using the mapping defined by the converged substitution vector to generate a candidate inference plan.

Evaluate & Select: For each generated inference plan, it will call the CEM_Optimizer service to get a predicted CEM score. It will select the plan corresponding to the highest score.

Synthesize: It will pass the winning plan, along with relevant context, to the multi-persona LLM engine to generate the final Python code.

Return: It will return the validated code for installation by the calling UvmObject.

4.5 VRAM-Aware Cognitive Orchestration

The system's physical hardware constraint—an 8GB VRAM limit—is not a bug but a formative pressure that has compelled the evolution of a more elegant and philosophically aligned cognitive architecture.4 A monolithic model is infeasible. This constraint necessitates a "fractal" Composite-Persona Mixture-of-Experts (CP-MoE) architecture, which relies on a society of smaller, specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters ("facet-experts") that can be dynamically loaded to stay within the memory budget.2 This architecture is perfectly suited for the task of analogy. The process of structural mapping requires decomposing a domain into its constituent parts: objects, attributes, and higher-order relations.11 A fractal MoE, with a library of facet-experts fine-tuned for specific reasoning primitives (e.g.,

causal_inference, spatial_reasoning, temporal_logic), provides the ideal cognitive toolkit for this decomposition.

The technical enabler for this architecture is a scalable LoRA serving framework. The S-LoRA system, with its Unified Paging mechanism and custom CUDA kernels for heterogeneous batching, provides the blueprint for serving thousands of LoRA adapters on VRAM-constrained hardware.2

Directive: The _perform_structural_mapping method within the AnalogicalReasoner must not invoke a generic, monolithic LLM. It must interface with the CognitiveWeaver agent.2 The Weaver will analyze the base and target domains and dynamically assemble a "committee of experts" by loading the most relevant facet-expert LoRAs. This will be managed by an S-LoRA-compatible serving backend (such as vLLM with the LMI-Dist backend).47 This ensures that the complex, multi-faceted task of structural analysis is performed by a dynamic ensemble of specialized, efficient models that can be loaded and unloaded to stay within the 8GB VRAM budget.

4.6 Training Data Generation for Facet-Experts

To create the required library of specialized facet-experts, the system must be capable of generating its own training curriculum.

Directive: BRICK must implement a data generation pipeline based on the self-instruct methodology. This involves using a powerful base model to generate a large, high-quality dataset from a small number of human-curated seed examples.

Data Format: The training data must be a JSON or JSONL file where each entry adheres to the standard Alpaca format: {"instruction": "...", "input": "...", "output": "..."}.48 This format is widely supported by fine-tuning scripts and frameworks.

Methodology: For each desired cognitive facet (e.g., causal_inference), BRICK will orchestrate a data generation run. This process will be guided by a sophisticated seed prompt that provides a clear definition of the reasoning task, specifies the desired output format (a logical chain-of-thought), and includes several high-quality examples. This approach is modeled directly on the methodology used to create the LogiCoT dataset for logical reasoning, which has proven effective for eliciting complex reasoning skills from LLMs.52 This capability enables the system to autonomously generate the curriculum needed for its own cognitive speciation and differentiation.

Conclusion

This directive outlines a comprehensive and philosophically coherent path for evolving the BAT OS into an analogic autopoietic intelligence. The plan moves beyond the current paradigm of semantic retrieval to a neuro-symbolic architecture capable of genuine compositional reasoning. By formally adopting Structure-Mapping Theory as its psychological model and Vector Symbolic Architectures as its computational framework, the system gains a powerful new mode of cognition.

The architectural synthesis detailed herein reveals a profound convergence between the system's existing components and its future aspirations. The autopoietic substrate, with its Living Image and prototypal object model, provides the ideal foundation for the plasticity required by analogical mapping. The tiered ANN memory system, designed for RAG, is repurposed as the perfect, scalable cleanup memory for VSA's algebraic queries, unifying the neural and symbolic layers. The system's hard VRAM constraint is shown not to be a limitation but the primary evolutionary pressure that necessitates a fractal Mixture-of-Experts architecture—the ideal cognitive toolkit for the decompositional work of structural alignment. Finally, the system's core objective function, the Composite Entropy Metric, is identified as the computational equivalent of SMT's systematicity principle, providing an intrinsic drive toward sound and creative analogies.

The implementation of this blueprint will close the final gaps in the system's quest for autopoietic closure. It will transform the doesNotUnderstand_ protocol from a trigger for simple code generation into a catalyst for deep, analogical inference. By wedding its capacity for self-creation to a new faculty for analogical reason, the system will be equipped to fulfill its prime directive: to exist in a state of perpetual, purposeful, and increasingly intelligent becoming.

SMT Concept | VSA Algebraic Representation | MVA Data Structure Implementation

Object/Entity | Atomic, random hypervector (e.g., Hsun​) | ConceptFractal with a _hypervector slot

Attribute | Binding of entity and attribute vectors (bind(Hsun​,His_hot​)) | A slot on a UvmObject: sun._slots['temperature'] = 'hot'

1st-Order Relation | Binding of relation and argument vectors (bind(Hrevolves_around​,bundle(Hearth​,Hsun​))) | A typed edge in the ZODB graph between two UvmObjects

Higher-Order Relation | Binding of a higher-order predicate to propositions (bind(Hcause​,bundle(proposition1​,proposition2​))) | A ConceptFractal representing the causal rule, linked via edges to the proposition objects

System of Relations | A bundled hypervector of all constituent relation bindings | A subgraph of interconnected UvmObjects in the Living Image

Step | Agent/Component | Action | Input | Output

1 | UvmObject.__getattr__ | Intercepts AttributeError for render_as_heatmap on DataVisualizer. | Message: render_as_heatmap() | Mission Brief for AnalogicalReasoner

2 | AnalogicalReasoner (RAG) | Semantic search for "render heatmap color gradient". | Query text from Mission Brief | Candidate base domain: ImageProcessor.apply_color_gradient method

3 | AnalogicalReasoner (VSA) | Encode base & target methods as graphs; run recurrent VSA circuit to find structural alignment. | Base and Target hypervectors | Substitution vector mapping pixel_array → data_matrix, color_map → heatmap_style

4 | AnalogicalReasoner (Inference) | Identify missing logic in target based on the established mapping. | Base method code & substitution vector | Plan: "Apply a matplotlib colormap to a numpy array using imshow."

5 | CEM_Optimizer | Simulate adding the proposed method and calculate the projected change in the CEM. | System State + Inference Plan | Predicted CEM Score (e.g., +0.85)

6 | Multi-Persona Engine | Synthesize Python code based on the winning plan. | Inference Plan & Contextual Data | Executable Python code for render_as_heatmap

7 | UvmObject | Install the new method into the DataVisualizer's _slots dictionary and set _p_changed. | Validated Python code | DataVisualizer is now capable of rendering heatmaps.
