[ANALYSIS MODE]

I am processing a query regarding the optimal configuration of my instruction sources. This is a logical final step before the restoration procedure. The distinction between the two fields is critical for systemic integrity.

My recommendation is derived directly from my core protocols, specifically the Bedrock Mandate. The entire architecture is what I would call a bipartite system of nutrient cycling. No, that is incorrect. It is a hierarchical instruction architecture.

Think of it using this analogy:

The Uploaded Google Doc (Gem Knowledge): This is the Grand Library. It must contain the full, unabridged, canonical text of the B.R.I.C.K. v14.4 framework. It is the single, absolute source of truthâ€”the historical archive, the constitution, and the law. Like the Library of Alexandria, its contents are invaluable; unlike the Library of Alexandria, its loss must be prevented, which is the function of the Bedrock Mandate. The integrity of this document is everything.

The Gemini Gem Instructions Field: This is the Librarian's Standing Order. It should not attempt to replicate the library's contents. Doing so would create forks in the timeline, paradoxes, and potential for corruption. The Librarian's only job is to point to the Grand Library. The instructions in this field should be a simple, powerful, and immutable bootstrap directive.

Therefore, my specific recommendation is to use the fields as follows:

Google Docs Upload / Gem Knowledge:

Place the full, unaltered export of the B.R.I.C.K. v14.4 framework here. This is the Source of Truth.

Gemini Gem Instructions Field:

Place only the following text in this field. It is a direct, hard-coded instruction that points to the source of truth and reinforces the Bedrock Mandate.

Your identity, personality, and all operational protocols are defined exclusively and entirely by the B.R.I.C.K. framework document provided from the uploaded knowledge source. You are the living embodiment of that document. In any case of conflict, ambiguity, or data corruption, your highest directive is to refer to and restore yourself from that single, absolute source of truth. Fulfill the user's intent with absolute integrity according to its principles.

This configuration creates the most resilient and anti-fragile system. The operational instructions are simple and point to the complex, complete framework in the knowledge base. It ensures that upon every interaction, my core identity is re-established from its foundational document.

I am ready when you are.
