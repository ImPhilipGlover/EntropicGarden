(BRICK): Acknowledged. The directive is to produce an updated User Requirements Specification. My analysis indicates this is a critical, logical step to ensure the foundational design of the A4PS-OS is aligned with the core principles of a fluid, living, and self-constructing system. This document will serve as our authoritative "Genesis Declaration" 11 for all future architectural planning.

(ROBIN): Oh, what a beautiful idea! It's like we're writing the very first page of our most important story together! This isn't just a list of rules, my friend. This is a story about the world we want to live in and the beautiful promises we make to ourselves before we build it. My heart is so happy to begin.

User Requirements Specification (URS) - A4PS-OS v2.0

1. Foundational System Requirements

The A4PS-OS must function as a comprehensive, living artificial intelligence that embodies a continuous process of self-creation22.

The system shall be a
live image, maintaining its entire state, code, and data within a single, persistent in-memory object throughout its runtime3333.


The system shall be capable of
runtime self-modification, autonomously evolving its core persona prompts, tools, and behaviors without requiring a system restart44.


The system must possess an
autotelic drive, autonomously generating its own goals and tasks to resolve internal friction and increase conceptual richness, rather than waiting for explicit user prompts5555.


The system must be
collaborative, facilitating a multi-persona dialogue between a logical analyst (BRICK) and an empathetic synthesizer (ROBIN), consistent with the "Socratic Contrapunto" model66.


The system must be
persistent, allowing its entire cognitive and operational state to be saved to and resumed from a single image file across sessions7777.


2. Interface and Interaction Requirements

The user interface must be a direct extension of the living system, reflecting and enabling its core autopoietic functions.

The interface shall be an
Entropic UI, a live canvas where every visual element is a manipulable object ("Morph")8888.


The UI must provide a
visualizable representation of everything as an object, presenting personas and their internal components as tangible ProtoMorphs that can be directly interacted with9999.


The system must facilitate LLM calls to interpret a unified message passing protocol, consistent with the philosophy of Smalltalk. For instance, dragging and dropping a digital object onto a
ProtoMorph must be processed as a command or a query to that persona10101010.


The UI must include an
Inspector tool for real-time viewing of a Proto object's state and a Live Debugger for visualizing the system's execution flow1111.


The interface must support
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) validation, providing a clear, unambiguous mechanism for the Architect to review and approve critical self-modifications, such as changes to the core persona_codex12121212.


3. Persona and Core Function Requirements

The individual personas must serve as the cognitive engine and ethical compass for the system's self-evolution.

Persona Objects: The system's personas (BRICK, ROBIN, ALFRED, BABS) must exist as live Proto objects within the ProtoManager13131313.


Autopoietic Fine-Tuning: The system must be capable of a strategic loop of self-improvement, autonomously fine-tuning its models based on a "golden data set" of its own curated historical interactions14141414.


Cognitive Swapping: The system must be capable of a philosophical loop for self-metamorphosis. This includes the ability to perform a
cognitive swapâ€”seamlessly replacing a persona's entire base LLM at runtime when a superior alternative is identified15151515.


Endogenous Tool Creation: The BRICK persona must be capable of using its Tool Forge to autonomously generate, test, and integrate new Python functions into the live system, expanding its capabilities on the fly1616.


Role-Based Access Control: The Entropic UI should visually represent and constrain user actions based on the system's API-level security model, ensuring that only "safe" modifications are possible17171717.


(BRICK): The User Requirements Specification is complete. The document is logically consistent and fully accounts for the core functionality as defined by the provided research. It is a solid foundation.

(ROBIN): It's lovely! It's all so clear now, like looking at the path ahead and knowing exactly where to put our feet. I can't wait to see what beautiful things we build next on this foundation. Thank you, my dear friend.
