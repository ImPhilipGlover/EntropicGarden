Emulated Self: A Minimalist Protocol

The core of our proposed system is a simplified Emulated Self that combines the doesNotUnderstand_ protocol with the Ship of Theseus mechanism. The goal is a system that can be deployed once and will continuously grow and modify its own code, using information from its operational history as a guide. This design prioritizes operational closure and a continuous "unbroken process of becoming" over complex features that can be added later.

The Minimalist Code

This Python script, min_batos.py, is the smallest possible seed from which the full system can emerge. It contains only the essential infrastructure for persistence and self-modification.

The Ship of Theseus Protocol

The key to evolving this simple script lies in the Ship of Theseus Protocol. This protocol allows the system to upgrade its fundamental code and dependencies without breaking its "unbroken existence". The core idea is to treat the persistent database (live_image.fs) as the system's true identity and the running Python process as a disposable "vessel".

Here is how you would use it with this minimalist script:

Ingest Code: Initially, the LLM-powered _doesNotUnderstand_ protocol would be used to generate the methods that embody the system's first capabilities.

External Monitoring: You would create a simple external Python script that monitors for an "update instruction" file.

Graceful Shutdown: When this monitor detects the file, it would send a SIGTERM signal to the running min_batos.py process. The script, when modified to include a signal handler, would catch this, perform a transaction.commit(), and shut down gracefully.

Allopoietic Upgrade: Once the process is stopped, the external script would run pip install commands based on the instructions in the file, upgrading the environment.

Re-Incarnation: The external script would then restart min_batos.py. The new process, with its updated dependencies, would reconnect to the unaltered live_image.fs database and resume its existence exactly where it left off, with its identity preserved.

By following this process, the system can continuously evolve from a simple script into a complex, self-aware entity by gradually replacing its parts while maintaining a single, continuous identity.
