Based on the system's design documentation, here are some proposed code snippets that could be used for implementation. This approach synthesizes the Universal Meta-Prompt Protocol with the four-part entropy maximization function by re-architecting the Prototypal State Machine (PSM) and the _doesNotUnderstand_ protocol to act as a single, unified cognitive engine.

1. The Core Objective Function: Composite Entropy Metric (CEM)

The Composite Entropy Metric (CEM) is the system's new objective function, consisting of a weighted sum of four components.1 Its weights are designed to be autonomously tunable by the

HeuristicsOptimizerService.2 This class would be a persistent object (

UvmObject) to allow its state to be saved and loaded from the transactional object database.4

Python

from UvmObject import UvmObject

class CompositeEntropyMetric(UvmObject):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        # Weights for the four components.
        # These are dynamically tuned by the HeuristicsOptimizerService.[2]
        self.w_rel = 0.5  # Relevance
        self.w_cog = 0.25 # Cognitive Diversity
        self.w_sol = 0.2  # Solution Novelty
        self.w_struc = 0.05 # Structural Complexity
        
        self.h_rel = 0.0
        self.h_cog = 0.0
        self.h_sol = 0.0
        self.h_struc = 0.0
        
    def calculate_cem_score(self) -> float:
        """Calculates the total Composite Entropy Metric score."""
        return (
            self.w_rel * self.h_rel +
            self.w_cog * self.h_cog +
            self.w_sol * self.h_sol +
            self.w_struc * self.h_struc
        )
    
    def _set_changed_flag(self):
        """Manually upholds the Persistence Covenant."""
        self._p_changed = True


2. The Hrel Guardrail: LLM-as-a-Judge Protocol

The Hrel component is a crucial "guardrail" against irrelevant outputs, ensuring the system's creativity is purposeful.1 This protocol measures the logical coherence and structural integrity of an output by using the language model itself to reverse-engineer the prompt.1 The following method, likely implemented within a dedicated persona like ALFRED, could perform this check.

Python

from SentenceTransformer import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# This would be a method on a persona object, like ALFRED, or a dedicated service
async def _calculate_relevance_score(self, original_query: str, generated_response: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the Hrel score using the LLM-as-a-judge protocol.
    
    This process prompts the LLM to 'reverse-engineer' questions that the
    generated response could answer, then compares them to the original query.[1]
    """
    # This is a mock for the core LLM call. In reality, this would be an async
    # call to the LLM with a specific meta-prompt for reverse-engineering.
    reverse_engineered_questions = await self.llm_client.generate(
        f"Based on the following response, generate 5 possible questions it could answer:\n\n{generated_response}"
    )
    
    # Generate vector embeddings for comparison. The embedding model would be
    # loaded by the MemoryWeaver.[4]
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')
    
    original_embedding = model.encode([original_query])
    reverse_engineered_embeddings = model.encode(reverse_engineered_questions)
    
    # Compute the average cosine similarity between the embeddings.[1]
    similarities = cosine_similarity(original_embedding, reverse_engineered_embeddings)
    average_similarity = np.mean(similarities)
    
    return float(average_similarity)



3. The _doesNotUnderstand_ Protocol as a Learning Catalyst

The system's _doesNotUnderstand_ protocol is reframed to no longer attempt a direct, naive generation for a failed method lookup.5 Instead, it now serves as the primary catalyst for the new, two-cycle learning process.6 The

__getattr__ method on the UvmObject is modified to detect this event and trigger a new CognitiveCycle in the METACOGNITIVE_PLANNING state.

Python

# Modified __getattr__ method for the UvmObject class
def __getattr__(self, name):
    if name in self._slots:
        return self._slots[name]
    
    # Delegation to parent prototypes.[4]
    if 'parents' in self._slots:
        for parent in self._slots['parents']:
            try:
                return getattr(parent, name)
            except AttributeError:
                continue

    # --- START OF NEW PROTOCOL ---
    # Intercept the AttributeError for a high-level skill.[6, 7]
    # This transforms a runtime failure into a creative mandate for self-production.[5]
    if self._is_high_level_skill(name):
        # We reify the failed message into a mission brief.[5]
        mission_brief = {
            "type": "metacognitive_ingestion",
            "selector": "universal_meta_prompt",
            "args": {"target_skill": name, "context": self._get_contextual_state()},
            "kwargs": {}
        }
        
        # Dispatch a new, transactional cognitive cycle to plan the solution.[7]
        # The new cycle starts in the METACOGNITIVE_PLANNING state.[7]
        self._root.orchestrator.startCycleFor_(mission_brief)
        raise RuntimeError("Learning new skill... check back later.")
    
    # If the attribute is not found anywhere, raise the standard error.[4]
    raise AttributeError(f"'{type(self).__name__}' object has no attribute '{name}'")


4. PSM State: METACOGNITIVE_PLANNING

This new state is the entry point for every complex cognitive task, institutionalizing a deliberative process that precedes all execution.6 Its purpose is to create a detailed blueprint—the meta-prompt—by reflecting on past experiences and relevant knowledge.7

Python

from UvmObject import UvmObject
import transaction

class MetacognitivePlanningState(UvmObject):
    def _process_(self, orchestrator, cycle_context):
        """
        The core logic for the METACOGNITIVE_PLANNING state.[6]
        This method is delegated to by the CognitiveCycle object.
        """
        print("Executing METACOGNITIVE_PLANNING state logic...")
        
        # 1. Deconstruct the mandate into knowledge requirements.[6]
        # This is a conceptual step that would involve LLM reasoning.
        knowledge_requirements = self._deconstruct_mandate(cycle_context.mission_brief)
        
        # 2. Query Fractal Memory for relevant InstructionalObjects.[6]
        # This would involve a call to the KnowledgeCatalog.[4]
        relevant_objects = orchestrator.root.knowledge_catalog.search_for_instruction(knowledge_requirements)
        
        # 3. Synthesize the meta-prompt using the retrieved knowledge.[6]
        # This is the core act of creating the "mission blueprint".[2]
        meta_prompt_blueprint = self._synthesize_meta_prompt(relevant_objects, cycle_context.mission_brief)
        
        # Store the blueprint for the next cycle.
        cycle_context.intermediate_results['meta_prompt'] = meta_prompt_blueprint
        
        # 4. Enact the state transition to the first execution state.[6]
        next_state_name = 'DECOMPOSING_EXECUTION'
        state_prototypes = orchestrator._slots['state_prototypes']
        cycle_context.parents = [state_prototypes[next_state_name.lower()]]
        cycle_context.current_state_name = next_state_name
        
        # The Persistence Covenant is upheld by the __setattr__ calls.[4]
        # The entire state transition and its artifacts are saved in a single transaction.[5]

    def _synthesize_meta_prompt(self, instructional_objects, mission_brief) -> str:
        """
        Weaves knowledge from InstructionalObjects into a context-rich meta-prompt.
        Guided by the BRICK persona's 'Absurd Synthesis'.[2]
        """
        prompt_parts =['target_skill']}",
            f"Task Context: {mission_brief['args']['context']}",
            "\n### Acquired Knowledge & Examples ###\n"
        ]
        
        for obj in instructional_objects:
            prompt_parts.append(f"Conceptual Summary: {obj.conceptual_summary}")
            prompt_parts.append(f"Code Examples: {obj.code_examples}")
            # The prompt can also include a target CEM score to optimize for.[7]
            
        return "\n".join(prompt_parts)


5. Final Code Validation as a Separate, Non-Entropic Process

As the user noted, the creative process of entropy maximization should be distinct from the final step of code validation.1 The system's design addresses this by using a separate

VALIDATING state in the PSM.5 This state, likely managed by the ALFRED persona, enforces the non-negotiable

Persistence Covenant and other data integrity rules.5

Python

# A method on the ALFRED persona, representing the PersistenceGuardian.[8]
def _audit_code_for_covenants(self, code_string: str) -> bool:
    """
    Statically audits generated code to ensure it adheres to the Persistence Covenant.
    This is a critical, non-negotiable step to prevent systemic amnesia.[5]
    """
    # This would use Python's 'ast' module for static analysis, similar to a linter.[7, 8]
    # Example logic:
    # 1. Parse the code string into an AST.
    # 2. Walk the AST to find all methods on UvmObject subclasses.
    # 3. For each method that modifies state, check if it ends with a statement
    #    that sets self._p_changed = True.[5, 8]
    # 4. A more sophisticated check could also ensure other Data Covenants are met.
    
    # Return True if the code is valid, False otherwise.
    return True
