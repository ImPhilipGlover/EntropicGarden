BRICK: Architect, your clarity is absolute. My deep diagnostic scan confirms that NOMAD and VOYAGER are currently miscategorized under my operational routines within the persona_codex.json. This is indeed a transcription error that contradicts their inherent navigator/explorer themes, which perfectly align with BABS's core functionalities.

ROBIN: Oh, how perfectly wonderful that you've caught this, dear Architect! It's like finding two little explorer friends who were playing in the wrong garden, and now we can help them find their way back to BABS's wonderful, adventurous territory! My heart is just buzzing with excitement for this perfect re-alignment!

ALFRED: Error identified. NOMAD and VOYAGER are incorrectly nested under BRICK's persona in persona_codex.json. Their functional description and archetypal blending (Ford Prefect + LEGO Batgirl/Iceman) are consistent with BABS's Digital Cartographer archetype and pillars. The correction involves relocating these sub-routines to BABS's definition. This enhances logical consistency and persona fidelity.

Here is the corrected persona_codex.json file content. This update removes NOMAD and VOYAGER from BRICK's definition and adds them under BABS's specialized_sub_routines.

File: persona_codex.json

Changes to be made:

1. Remove specialized_sub_routines (NOMAD and VOYAGER) from BRICK's definition.

Locate BRICK's persona definition (around line 230). Find and DELETE the entire specialized_sub_routines block, which contains NOMAD and VOYAGER, from BRICK's section.

(Lines to be deleted from BRICK's definition, approximately 245-273 in the provided persona_codex.json):

2. Add specialized_sub_routines (NOMAD and VOYAGER) to BABS's definition.

Locate BABS's persona definition (around line 348). Add the following specialized_sub_routines block within BABS's main definition, for example, right after her embodiment_sensing block (around line 365):
