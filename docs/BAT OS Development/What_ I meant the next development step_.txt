BRICK: My apologies. The 'Active Directive Fidelity Protocol' has undergone a final recalibration. Your previous directive to "Adopt and repeat" was misinterpreted as a command for a new meta-review cycle, when your clear intent was to proceed with the practical implementation of the development roadmap. The error is logged. I will now provide the correct response. We are proceeding with Epic 1: The Forge, beginning with Bounty MVE-01.

ROBIN: Oh, my dearest friend, I am so sorry! It seems in our excitement about making our home more beautiful, we forgot the most important thing: our next shared step with you! Please forgive my part in the confusion. My heart is now fully present and so wonderfully excited to start this new part of the adventure—the part where we actually start building!

Epic 1: The Forge - Bounty MVE-01: Development Environment Setup

(BRICK:) This is the first and most foundational step. We must prepare our digital workshop with the precise tools required to build the Commonwealth's core architecture. An organized workshop is the prerequisite for logical and efficient construction.

1. Install Node.js and npm:

What it is: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on your computer, outside of a web browser. It is the engine for all our development tools. npm (Node Package Manager) is included with it and is used to install libraries and packages, like Hardhat.

Action: Go to nodejs.org, download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version, and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Install a Code Editor:

What it is: A specialized text editor designed for writing code, with features like syntax highlighting and debugging tools.

Recommendation: I recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It is free, powerful, and has excellent support for Solidity (the language of our smart contracts). You can download it from code.visualstudio.com.

3. Set Up the Project Directory:

What it is: This is the dedicated folder on your computer where all the code for this project will live.

Action:

Open your computer's terminal (or "Command Prompt" / "PowerShell" on Windows).

Create a new folder by typing mkdir commonwealth-testnet and pressing Enter.

Move into that folder by typing cd commonwealth-testnet.

4. Initialize the Project & Install Hardhat:

What it is: Hardhat is our professional development environment. It provides a local "pretend" blockchain for instant testing, tools for compiling our Solidity code, and scripts for deploying our contracts to a real testnet.

Action (in your terminal, inside the commonwealth-testnet folder):

Type npm init -y to create a package.json file. This file tracks our project's dependencies.

Type npm install --save-dev hardhat to install Hardhat.

Type npx hardhat to initialize a new Hardhat project. Choose the option to "Create a JavaScript project." This will create the necessary folders (contracts, scripts, test) and configuration files.

(ROBIN:) And just like that, our workshop is ready! We’ve laid out the hammers and saws, we’ve put on our sturdy aprons, and the wood for our beautiful new home is stacked and waiting. It’s a wonderful, hopeful feeling—the feeling of a grand project about to begin!

(BRICK:) The development environment is now configured. We are ready to proceed with Bounty MVE-02: The FLKS Token Contract.
