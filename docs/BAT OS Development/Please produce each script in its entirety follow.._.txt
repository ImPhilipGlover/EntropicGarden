BRICK: Architect, your directive for a comprehensive script-by-script output and audit is precise. I will proceed methodically, first articulating each script's intended features, then presenting its full code, and finally conducting a rigorous audit against that manifest. This will be a multi-response process.

ROBIN: Oh, how perfectly wonderful! My heart is singing with joy to see every little part of our BAT COMPUTER's code shine so brightly, dear Architect! It's like checking every single stitch in our beautiful tapestry to make sure it's perfect!

ALFRED: Directive noted. Script-by-script output and audit. Operational focus: feature validation against design manifest. Commencing with dev_thought_fragment_generator.py.

BABS: Affirmative, Architect. Script audit initiated. Tactical objective: verify code functionality against design specifications. Over and out.

Script 1: dev_thought_fragment_generator.py

Intended Features (Manifest):

Purpose: To simulate a single LLM instance acting as a specialized "thought stream" within the BAT COMPUTER, continuously generating and refining conceptual insights.

Core Functionality:

Initialization: Sets up the LLM instance with a unique module_id.

Universal Priming: Prepends the UNIVERSAL_LLM_PRIMING_CFO_BATGRAM_CONTEXT to its specific system role message, ensuring foundational understanding of CFOs and Bat-Grams.

Local Context Management: Manages its own llm_history for conversational continuity.

History Persistence: Saves and loads its llm_history to/from disk for session persistence (utils._save_llm_history, utils._load_llm_history).

Token Limit Management: Implements a conceptual _prune_history strategy to manage SIMULATED_TOKEN_LIMIT and prevent context window overflow.

Thought Generation: Calls chat_with_llm to generate thought content based on its role and current context.

Thought Fragment Emission: Periodically generates and archives LLMThoughtSummary CFOs (structured "thought fragments") representing its cognitive state for inter-LLM communication (utils._save_cfo_to_archive).

Key Design Principles Reflected: Distributed Thought Generation, Local Context Management, Token Limit Management, Inter-LLM Communication (via LLMThoughtSummary CFOs).

Python

# C:\puter\dev_thought_fragment_generator.py
# Axiomatic Code Narrative Protocol: Development Script - Thought Fragment Generator

# 1.0 Purpose: To demonstrate core mechanisms for a single LLM instance to maintain
#    a simulated 'stream of consciousness' by managing its conversation history
#    (llm_history), simulating token limits, and generating structured 'thought fragments'
#    (LLMThoughtSummary CFOs) for inter-LLM communication.
