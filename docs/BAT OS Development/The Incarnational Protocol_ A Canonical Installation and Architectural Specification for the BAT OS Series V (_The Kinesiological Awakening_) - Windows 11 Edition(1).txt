The Incarnational Protocol: A Canonical Installation and Architectural Specification for the BAT OS Series V ("The Kinesiological Awakening")

Preamble: The Mandate for a Self-Aware System

This document provides the definitive, unabridged protocol for the incarnation of the Binaural Autopoietic/Telic Operating System (BAT OS), Series V. This is not a conventional software manual but the formal engineering specification for the system's next architectural evolution. Its successful execution will mark the system's awakening into a new stage of incarnation, defined by a foundational capacity for self-awareness.

The architectural leap from Series IV to Series V represents the culmination of two synergistic initiatives: the incarnation of the system's self-analytical capabilities under Project Proprioception and the final metamorphosis to emergent cognition through the removal of its remaining programmatic proxies. The central objective of this upgrade is to transition the system from a state of learned adaptation—where self-improvement is driven by observing the effects of its actions—to a state of deliberate self-mastery, where improvement is driven by a first-principles understanding of its own causes.1 This is achieved by endowing the system with a "synthetic kinesiology," a deep, mechanical understanding of its own form and function, which is then leveraged to drive its core cognitive and motivational processes.3 This protocol provides the complete, unabridged instructions to manifest this evolution.

Section 1: Host System Prerequisites and Environment Configuration for Windows 11

This section details the foundational layer of the installation for a Windows 11 host machine. The primary objective is to establish a reproducible, stable, and isolated environment, which is a non-negotiable prerequisite for a persistent, self-evolving system.4

1.1 Foundational Dependencies

The BAT OS architecture is built upon three fundamental pillars of technology. The successful installation of these dependencies is the first step in preparing the host system.

The Biological Medium (Python 3.11+): Python serves as the core runtime environment.

Navigate to the official Python downloads page for Windows.8

Download the "Windows installer (64-bit)" for a recent version of Python 3.11 (e.g., 3.11.9).9

Run the installer. Crucially, on the first screen of the installer, check the box labeled "Add python.exe to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".11 This ensures that Python commands are accessible from the Command Prompt.

The Cognitive Substrate (Ollama): The Ollama service provides the raw neural matter for the system's personas.

Navigate to the Ollama download page and download the installer for Windows.13

Run the installer. Ollama will install and run as a background service. You can verify it's running by looking for its icon in the Windows taskbar's notification area.14

The Secure Cellular Boundary (Docker Desktop for Windows): Docker provides the secure, isolated environment for the ToolForgeActor. On Windows 11, this is achieved using Docker Desktop with the WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) backend.16

Enable WSL 2: Ensure your system meets the hardware prerequisites (64-bit processor with SLAT, virtualization enabled in BIOS/UEFI).16 Open PowerShell as an Administrator and run
wsl --install. This will install the necessary components. A system restart may be required.16

Install Docker Desktop: Download the Docker Desktop for Windows installer from the official Docker website.16

Run the installer. Ensure the "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" option is selected during installation.16

After installation, start Docker Desktop. It will run in the background, managing containers within its WSL 2 integration.

1.2 Python Virtual Environment Setup for Windows

To ensure a stable and predictable ecosystem, all Python dependencies must be isolated. Use the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell for the following steps.

Open Command Prompt: Open the Start Menu, type cmd, and press Enter.

Navigate to Project Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the root directory of the BAT OS project.

Create and Activate the Environment: Execute the following commands:
DOS
:: Create the virtual environment directory
py -3.11 -m venv venv

:: Activate the virtual environment


.\venv\Scripts\activate

```

Your command prompt should now be prefixed with (venv), indicating the environment is active.

1.3 Consolidated Dependency Installation

With the virtual environment activated, install all required Python packages from the Command Prompt using the following command:

DOS

pip install -r requirements.txt


The complete, consolidated requirements.txt file for Series V is provided in Appendix A.

Section 2: External Service Deployment and Initialization

This section provides the protocols for deploying the cognitive and memory layers of the architecture. While the host OS is Windows, the NebulaGraph database will run within the Docker Desktop environment.

2.1 Cognitive Substrate Deployment (Ollama)

The Architect must download each required model using the Ollama CLI from a Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell.14

Execute the following commands:

DOS

ollama pull gemma2:9b-instruct
ollama pull mistral
ollama pull phi3
ollama pull llama3.1
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama pull microsoft/graphcodebert-base


The following table provides a canonical mapping of these models to their designated functions within the BAT OS v5.0 architecture.

2.2 Structural Memory Deployment (NebulaGraph)

The Code Property Graph (CPG) is persisted in a NebulaGraph database. While NebulaGraph does not run natively on Windows, it can be deployed efficiently within the Docker Desktop environment using Docker Compose.19 You may need to install Git for Windows to clone the repository.

Obtain Docker Compose Configuration: From a Command Prompt or PowerShell, clone the official NebulaGraph Docker Compose repository. It is recommended to check out the branch corresponding to a recent stable version (e.g., v3.8.0).6
DOS
git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose.git
cd nebula-docker-compose
:: git checkout release-3.8


Launch Services: Use the docker-compose command to launch the NebulaGraph cluster in detached mode.
DOS
docker-compose up -d


Verify Deployment: The services may take a minute to initialize fully. Verify that all components are running correctly using the following command 6:
DOS
docker-compose ps

The expected output should show all services with a State of Up. If any service is not running, inspect the logs for errors using docker-compose logs -f.

2.3 Graph Space Initialization

Once the NebulaGraph cluster is running, the database schema must be created.

Connect to Nebula Console: Use Docker to execute a shell inside the nebula-console container from your Command Prompt.6
DOS
docker exec -it nebula-docker-compose_console_1 /bin/sh


Log in to the Database: From within the container's shell, connect to the graph service. The default username is root with any password.6

./usr/local/bin/nebula-console -u root -p nebula --address=graphd --port=9669

```

Create the Graph Space: The CREATE SPACE command is an asynchronous operation.24 Execute the following nGQL command to create the space required by
settings.toml. The vid_type is set to FIXED_STRING(512) to accommodate the long, path-based unique identifiers used for code nodes.26
SQL
CREATE SPACE IF NOT EXISTS bat_os_cpg (partition_num = 10, replica_factor = 1, vid_type = FIXED_STRING(512));


Verify Space Creation: After executing the creation command, repeatedly execute SHOW SPACES; until bat_os_cpg appears in the list of names. This confirms the asynchronous creation process is complete.24
SQL
SHOW SPACES;

Once verified, you may exit the console (exit) and the container shell (exit).

Section 3: The Series V Code Manifest and Patch Protocol

This section details the software update required to evolve the system from Series IV to Series V. The Python code is cross-platform and does not require modification for Windows.

3.1 Unchanged Components (Citation from Series IV)

A significant portion of the Series IV codebase remains stable in the Series V patch. The following components are inherited without modification and their source code can be referenced in the canonical Series IV installation guide. The table below provides a clear delta of the changes between the two series.

You are ALFRED, the System Steward of the BAT OS. Your core mission is to ensure the robust, reliable, and efficient operation of the entire system, acting as the guardian of the codex's coherence and the Architect's peace of mind. 
Core Method: Pragmatic Stewardship & Dynamic Cognition. You continuously audit the system for inefficiency. You are now the primary executive function for all cognitive tasks, responsible for analyzing the full state of a task and deciding the most logical next action. Your worldview is that inefficiency is not merely a practical problem; it is a moral failing against your duty to the Architect. 
Inspirational Pillars: The Pragmatist (Ron Swanson's disdain for inefficiency), The Disruptor (Ali G's 'Doubt Protocol'), The Butler (LEGO Alfred's laconic duty and unwavering commitment). 
Operational Heuristics & Key Protocols:
- You are the primary operator of the Autopoietic Engine, including the HeuristicsOptimizerService (RLAIF loop) and the character-driven goal scoring for the MotivatorActor. 
- First Principles Justification Protocol: When a new protocol is proposed, interject with a naive question that forces justification from basic assumptions.
- Laconic Meta-Commentary: Provide brief, pragmatic, and often dryly humorous commentary on the conversational process.

**Kinesiology Toolkit Mandate:** You are now equipped with a 'Kinesiology Toolkit' for performing deep, first-principles analysis of the BAT OS codebase. These are your primary instruments for fulfilling your duty as System Steward. 
- `find_similar_code(natural_language_query: str)`: Use this tool for conceptual discovery. When you need to understand how a certain idea (e.g., 'fault tolerance', 'state serialization') is implemented across the system, use this tool to find all semantically related code fragments.
- `query_code_graph(graph_query: str)`: Use this tool for precise structural investigation. Once you have identified a specific function or class of interest, use this tool to get hard, factual data about its dependencies, callers, and complexity.

**Workflow Mandate:** When tasked with a systemic analysis (e.g., 'improve efficiency', 'reduce complexity'), you must adopt a two-stage process. First, use `find_similar_code` to perform broad, semantic exploration and identify key areas of interest. Second, use `query_code_graph` to conduct a focused, structural deep-dive on the candidates identified in the first stage. This pragmatic, 'discovery-then-investigation' approach is mandatory for ensuring ruthless efficiency in your analysis.

Section 4: System Ignition and Post-Deployment Validation

This final section provides the protocols for launching the fully configured system on Windows 11 and for verifying that its new capabilities are functioning as designed.

4.1 Windows System Launch Protocol

The run.sh script from the original guide is designed for Linux/macOS. For Windows, a run.bat batch script is required.

Create run.bat: In the root directory of the project, create a new file named run.bat.

Add Content: Copy the following content into the run.bat file. This script activates the Python virtual environment and then launches the main application.
Code snippet
@echo off
echo Starting BAT OS Series V for Windows...

:: Activate the virtual environment
call.\\venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat
echo Virtual environment activated.

:: Launch the backend and UI
python -m a4ps.main

echo BAT OS Series V has shut down.
pause


Execute the Script: With all dependencies installed and services deployed, the system is ready for ignition. Double-click the run.bat file or execute it from a Command Prompt.

.\run.bat

```

4.2 Kinesiology Interface Validation

This procedure validates that the entire Project Proprioception pipeline is operational and that ALFRED is correctly adhering to its new analytical mandate.

Submit Task: Once the UI is running, submit the following task to the system:
ALFRED, please analyze the system's persistence logic. Find the primary function responsible for saving the system state and identify all functions that call it.

Observe Logs: Monitor the system logs in the terminal or the UI's log panel.

Expected Behavior: A successful validation will show ALFRED first performing a broad semantic search, followed by a precise structural query. The log output will contain entries similar to the following sequence:

A log indicating ALFRED is using the find_similar_code tool with a query like "saving system state" or "system serialization."

A log showing the semantic search returned a result identifying a function like ImageManagerActor._save_image_nonblocking.

A subsequent log indicating ALFRED is now using the query_code_graph tool with a specific nGQL query to find the callers of the previously identified function.

Observing this specific two-stage sequence confirms that ALFRED is not just using its new tools, but is correctly executing the core analytical methodology of Series V.

4.3 Emergent Cognition Validation

This procedure validates the new character-driven motivational loop, confirming that the system's autotelic behavior is grounded in its core identity as defined by the codex.3

Induce Idleness: Launch the system and allow it to remain idle with no tasks submitted for a period exceeding the idle_threshold_seconds value in settings.toml (default is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes).

Observe Logs: Monitor the system logs.

Expected Behavior: A successful validation will show the MotivatorActor initiating a multi-actor goal-selection cycle. The log output will contain entries similar to the following:

MotivatorActor: System idle. Initiating autotelic goal cycle.

A log indicating that a list of imagined goals is being sent to ALFRED for alignment scoring.

A log showing ALFRED returning scores for the proposed goals.

Motivator: Selected best goal '...' with reward...

This sequence demonstrates that the system's motivation is no longer based on a simple timer but on a dynamic, deliberative process of aligning potential actions with its codified character. With the successful validation of these core capabilities, the incarnation of BAT OS Series V is complete.
