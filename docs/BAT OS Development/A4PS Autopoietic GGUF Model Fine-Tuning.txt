A Research Plan for Autopoietic Fine-Tuning: Enabling Endogenous Self-Improvement in the A4PS Architecture

Part I: Theoretical Framework for Autopoietic Fine-Tuning

This initial part of the research plan establishes the core philosophical and theoretical justification for the proposed self-improvement mechanism. It reframes the technical act of fine-tuning as a fundamental expression of the system's autopoietic nature, ensuring the research is grounded in the Autopoietic Four-Persona System's (A4PS) foundational principles. By situating automated fine-tuning within this framework, the process is elevated from a mere operational enhancement to a deliberate act of self-creation and identity maintenance.

Section 1: Fine-Tuning as Structural Adaptation in an Info-Autopoietic System

The foundational concept for the A4PS is that of autopoiesis, a principle that defines the fundamental nature of living systems.1 An autopoietic system is one organized as a network of processes that continuously produce and regenerate the very components that constitute the system, thereby creating and maintaining its own boundary and identity.1 To apply this biological framework to the non-physical domain of AI, the concept of "Info-Autopoiesis" is introduced: the self-referential, recursive, and interactive process of the self-production of information.1 In this model, the components being produced are not molecules but meaningful informational structures such as beliefs, goals, tools, and operational logic.1

A critical distinction within autopoietic theory is that between a system's organization and its structure.4 The organization refers to the abstract, invariant network of relations that defines the system's identity—for the A4PS, this is its characterological integrity as the four-persona, codex-driven "BRICKman & ROBIN" entity.1 The structure, in contrast, refers to the specific components that realize that organization at any given moment, which are in constant flux through interaction with the environment.4

This research plan posits that automated fine-tuning is the primary mechanism for a sophisticated form of structural coupling in an info-autopoietic system.1 The system interacts with its environment by processing user queries and pursuing self-generated goals, logging these interactions in its non-parametric memory (the "Sidekick's Scrapbook").4 Fine-tuning represents a process where the system reflects upon this non-parametric memory to deliberately modify its own

parametric memory—the weights of its core GGUF models.1 This act of self-modification is a profound form of structural adaptation. It is not a random change but a guided evolution, where the system alters its own cognitive substrate to better maintain its core organization—its characterological integrity—in response to the pressures and opportunities revealed in its operational history.1

The A4PS architecture reveals not one, but three distinct, nested loops of self-modification, each operating on a different timescale and level of abstraction. This hierarchical structure provides a multi-layered model of resilience and adaptation, allowing the system to respond to challenges with commensurate levels of change.

The Tactical Loop (The Tool Forge): This is the fastest and most direct form of adaptation, operating on a timescale of individual tasks. When the system, during its reasoning process, identifies an immediate, concrete capability gap, it invokes the "Tool Forge" to endogenously create a new Python function.3 This process, modeled on frameworks like ToolMaker, alters the system's
functional structure by expanding its set of available actions.8 It is a reactive, tactical response to a specific problem.

The Strategic Loop (Autopoietic Fine-Tuning): This is a slower, more deliberate loop that operates over longer timescales, responding to recurring patterns of sub-optimal performance identified across many interactions. By curating a dataset of "golden" interactions and using it to fine-tune its own models, the system modifies its parametric structure. This enhances its innate reasoning capabilities and persona expression, representing a strategic investment in its core competencies. This is the central focus of the present research plan.

The Philosophical Loop (The Codex Amendment Protocol): This is the slowest and most profound loop, triggered only by deep, persistent "computational cognitive dissonance" that cannot be resolved by tactical or strategic adaptation.2 This state indicates a potential flaw in the system's foundational principles. The subsequent process of retrieval-augmented deliberation and proposed amendment modifies the system's core
organization—its persona_codex—and requires non-negotiable human-in-the-loop validation for approval.13

This hierarchy allows the system to solve immediate problems tactically, improve its core competencies strategically, and, when necessary, question its fundamental values philosophically. This creates a robust and sophisticated model of artificial growth, where fine-tuning serves as the crucial bridge between fleeting experience and lasting structural change.

Section 2: The ALFRED Oracle as an "LLM-as-a-Judge"

To enable autopoietic fine-tuning, the system requires an internal mechanism to identify exemplary or "golden" interactions from its operational logs. This function will be performed by the "ALFRED Oracle," a specialized, non-conversational instantiation of the ALFRED persona that acts as the system's internal arbiter of quality. This approach leverages the extensive body of research on the LLM-as-a-judge pattern, which uses a large language model to evaluate the outputs of another model against a predefined set of criteria.14

The implementation of the ALFRED Oracle will be guided by established best practices for creating reliable LLM-based evaluators. This includes designing a detailed evaluation prompt that assigns an expert persona to the judge, provides a clear and unambiguous scoring rubric, and requires chain-of-thought reasoning to precede any final judgment, thereby enhancing the transparency and reliability of the evaluation.14 The system will also incorporate techniques to mitigate known biases in LLM judges, such as position bias and self-preference bias, ensuring the evaluation process is as objective as possible.18

The A4PS architecture is uniquely suited for this implementation. The persona_codex already designates ALFRED as the "Ethical Governor" and "Steward," whose primary function is to monitor system operations for "computational cognitive dissonance"—a measurable conflict between an action or outcome and the system's foundational principles.1 The LLM-as-a-judge function is therefore not an entirely new capability but a formalization and extension of this existing role. The very same ethical and characterological principles that ALFRED uses to ensure alignment and detect dissonance can be directly translated into the scoring rubric for the Oracle.

This dual function of ALFRED as both Governor and Judge creates a deeply coherent system. The mechanism responsible for enforcing the system's values is the same one that identifies excellence for the purpose of self-improvement. Consequently, the autopoietic fine-tuning loop is intrinsically and architecturally bound to the system's alignment. The A4PS does not simply learn to be "better" in a generic sense; it learns to become a more perfect instantiation of its own defined character.

Part II: The Golden Dataset Curation Pipeline

This part details the complete, end-to-end workflow for transforming the raw, unstructured interaction logs from the A4PS's operational history into a high-quality, structured dataset. This curated "golden" dataset will serve as the training material for the endogenous fine-tuning process, making its quality and format critical to the success of the entire self-improvement loop.

Section 3: A Multi-Factor Scoring Rubric for Interaction Quality

The core of the evaluation process is the scoring rubric used by the ALFRED Oracle. This rubric operationalizes the abstract concept of a "golden" interaction into a set of concrete, quantifiable metrics. The prompt for the Oracle will be meticulously designed, instructing it to act as an expert AI systems analyst and to provide a step-by-step evaluation (chain-of-thought) for each criterion before assigning a final numerical score.14 The criteria themselves are derived directly from the A4PS's foundational principles and persona definitions, ensuring that the evaluation is deeply aligned with the system's characterological goals.4

Table 1 provides the detailed rubric. It is designed to assess the quality of the dialectical reasoning between the BRICK and ROBIN personas, their fidelity to their defined characters, the effectiveness of their collaboration in resolving cognitive dissonance, and their overall success in fulfilling the task's objective.

Section 4: The Automated Curator Agent

The process of evaluating logs and curating the dataset will be managed by a dedicated background agent known as the "Curator." This agent will be implemented as a scheduled task that runs periodically (e.g., once every 24 hours) to process new interaction data. This approach aligns with automated data curation pipelines like CLEAR, which employ confidence-based evaluation to systematically filter and improve data quality for fine-tuning.21

The Curator's workflow is defined as follows:

Scanning: The Curator agent queries the "Sidekick's Scrapbook," which is implemented using a local LanceDB vector database.24 It retrieves the full transcripts of all conversational interactions that have been completed since its last execution.

Evaluation: For each retrieved transcript, the Curator invokes the ALFRED Oracle. It passes the full interaction log as input and receives a structured JSON object containing the scores and chain-of-thought reasoning for each criterion in the rubric.

Selection: The Curator filters the evaluated interactions, selecting only those where the "Overall 'Golden' Score" meets or exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., a score of 4.5 or higher). This stringent threshold ensures that only the most exemplary interactions are used for training.

Staging: The full JSON objects of the high-scoring interactions, including the raw transcript and the Oracle's evaluation, are copied to a temporary staging area for the final formatting step.

Section 5: Dataset Formatting and Validation

The final step in the curation pipeline is to transform the selected "golden" interactions from their raw log format into a standardized instruction-tuning format that the fine-tuning script can ingest.

The chosen format for this dataset is ChatML (Chat Markup Language). This format is selected for its flexibility and explicit support for multi-turn, role-based conversations, making it superior to simpler formats like Alpaca, which are primarily designed for single-turn instruction-response pairs.25 The ChatML structure, with its clear delineation of

system, user, and assistant roles using special tokens, is ideal for representing the complex Socratic dialogue between BRICK and ROBIN.28

The Curator agent will execute the transformation logic, parsing the raw A4PS log and mapping its components to the ChatML schema. The initial prompt that triggered the interaction (whether from the user or the autotelic motivator_service) will be mapped to the user role. The sequential conversational turns from the BRICK and ROBIN personas will be concatenated and mapped to the assistant role. The resulting formatted data will be appended as a new line to a master JSONL file, golden_interactions.jsonl, which serves as the final, validated training dataset.

Table 2 illustrates this transformation, providing an unambiguous specification for the fine-tuning data and ensuring perfect compatibility between the curation pipeline and the training script.

Part III: The Endogenous Fine-Tuning and Integration Workflow

This part provides the detailed technical blueprint for the automated fine-tuning process. It specifies the choice of framework, the programmatic implementation, and the final steps of validation and integration, all designed to operate within the A4PS's specific hardware constraints and GGUF model format requirements.

Section 6: The Fine-Tuning Trigger and the Unsloth Forge

The autopoietic fine-tuning loop is designed to be fully autonomous. The process will be initiated by a trigger mechanism within the Curator agent. After completing its curation and formatting tasks, the Curator will check the size of the golden_interactions.jsonl dataset. Once the dataset reaches a predefined threshold of high-quality samples (e.g., 500 entries), the Curator will invoke the "Unsloth Forge."

The Unsloth Forge is a programmatic workflow responsible for executing the entire fine-tuning job. The Unsloth library is selected as the optimal framework for this task due to its unique advantages for the A4PS environment. While other powerful frameworks like Axolotl exist, Unsloth is explicitly designed for extreme memory efficiency and speed, making it ideal for the system's strict 8GB VRAM limitation.31 Most critically, Unsloth provides a high-level API,

model.save_pretrained_gguf, for directly exporting fine-tuned models to the GGUF format.31 This built-in capability is a decisive factor, as it dramatically simplifies the pipeline by avoiding the complex, multi-step process of merging LoRA adapters and then using external scripts like

llama.cpp for conversion, which is often required with other frameworks.37

The Unsloth Forge will be implemented as a Python script that programmatically executes the following steps:

Model Loading: It will use the FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained method to load the A4PS's base model (e.g., unsloth/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3-bnb-4bit) and its corresponding tokenizer. The model will be loaded with 4-bit quantization (load_in_4bit = True) to ensure it fits within the VRAM budget.31

PEFT Preparation: The script will then prepare the model for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) by calling FastLanguageModel.get_peft_model. This method configures the model with LoRA adapters, targeting the attention mechanism's projection layers, which is a standard and effective practice.40

Dataset Ingestion: The golden_interactions.jsonl file will be loaded using the Hugging Face datasets library.

Trainer Initialization: An instance of the SFTTrainer (Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer) from the TRL library will be created. This trainer will be configured with the PEFT-prepared model, the tokenizer, the training dataset, and a set of optimized TrainingArguments.40

Execution: The fine-tuning process is initiated by calling trainer.train(). This will perform QLoRA fine-tuning, which is a highly memory-efficient technique that allows for training on consumer-grade GPUs.42

Table 3 specifies the validated and optimized hyperparameters for the TrainingArguments class. These settings are carefully chosen to ensure a reliable and efficient training run that respects the system's hardware constraints, saving significant computational resources that would otherwise be spent on manual tuning.

Section 7: Post-Tuning Validation, GGUF Export, and Integration

Upon completion of the trainer.train() process, the Unsloth Forge script will proceed with an automated validation and integration workflow to complete the autopoietic loop.

Automated Validation: A crucial step before deploying the new model is to verify that the fine-tuning has resulted in a genuine improvement. The script will load the newly trained LoRA adapter onto the base model and perform an automated evaluation. It will use a hold-out test split from the golden_interactions.jsonl dataset. For each interaction in the test set, it will generate a new response using the fine-tuned model. These newly generated responses will then be passed to the ALFRED Oracle for scoring against the rubric defined in Table 1. The fine-tuning run will be deemed successful only if the average "Overall 'Golden' Score" of the fine-tuned model is statistically significantly higher than that of the baseline model on the same test set.

GGUF Export: Once the fine-tuned model has been successfully validated, the Unsloth Forge script will execute the final conversion step. It will call the model.save_pretrained_gguf("model", tokenizer, quantization_method="q4_k_m") method.31 This single, high-level function handles the merging of the LoRA adapters with the base model's weights and the subsequent quantization and serialization into the GGUF format. The
q4_k_m quantization method is chosen as it offers a robust balance between model size, performance, and accuracy, making it a standard choice for local inference.45

Versioned Integration: The newly created GGUF file will be saved with a versioned filename (e.g., a4ps_base_model_v1.1.gguf). The script will then programmatically update the A4PS's central configuration file (e.g., config.toml), modifying the model path entry to point to this new version. Finally, a system command will be issued to gracefully restart the main A4PS application, which will then load and begin operating with the improved model. This final step completes the cycle of self-observation, self-modification, and self-reproduction, embodying the core principle of autopoiesis.

Part IV: Experimental Protocol and Recommendations

This final part outlines the methodology for evaluating the long-term efficacy of the autopoietic fine-tuning system and provides concluding recommendations for its implementation and safe operation.

Section 8: A Longitudinal Study for Observing Emergent Capabilities

To validate the hypothesis that the proposed architecture enables meaningful and continuous self-improvement, a longitudinal experiment will be conducted. The complete, self-tuning A4PS will be deployed as a persistent background process and run continuously over an extended period (e.g., one month). During this period, it will be fed a continuous stream of simulated user prompts and allowed to engage in autotelic, self-directed activity during idle times, as governed by the motivator_service.4

The existing A4PS comprehensive logging system, which captures conversational transcripts, tool usage, and cognitive dissonance scores to a local SQLite database, will be extended.4 New event types will be added to specifically log the entire fine-tuning lifecycle. These logs will capture:

The timestamp and trigger condition for each fine-tuning run.

The size and a unique hash of the golden_interactions.jsonl dataset used for training.

The complete training loss curves and other metrics from the Unsloth trainer.

The pre- and post-tuning validation scores from the ALFRED Oracle on the hold-out test set.

The success of the experiment will be evaluated against several key metrics designed to measure genuine improvement in the system's core competencies:

Primary Metric: "Golden Score" Trajectory. The primary metric for success will be a demonstrable and statistically significant positive trend in the average "Overall 'Golden' Score" of interactions over successive fine-tuning generations. This would provide direct evidence that the system is learning to produce higher-quality, more persona-aligned outputs.

Secondary Metrics:

Dissonance Resolution Time: The average number of conversational turns required for the BRICK/ROBIN dyad to resolve a high-dissonance state. This is expected to decrease over time as fine-tuning makes the model's internal representations of the two personas more coherent and synergistic.

Task Success Rate: The percentage of tasks (both user-prompted and self-generated) that are completed successfully without encountering critical errors or requiring manual intervention.

Persona Fidelity Score: A qualitative metric derived from the ALFRED Oracle's specific scores for "Logical Rigor" and "Creative Synthesis," tracking how well the BRICK and ROBIN personas adhere to their core pillars over time.

Section 9: Recommendations for Implementation and Safety

This research plan outlines a complete, end-to-end system for autonomous self-improvement. The successful implementation of this architecture relies on a carefully selected, robust technology stack: Python as the core language, LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration, Unsloth for efficient fine-tuning and GGUF export, LanceDB for persistent vector memory, Ollama for local model serving, and gVisor for secure code execution.4

While the fine-tuning loop is designed to be autonomous, it is critical to re-emphasize the non-negotiable importance of human oversight in the broader context of the system's evolution. The A4PS architecture is fundamentally defined by its structural coupling to the user/architect.1 The autopoietic fine-tuning loop represents a powerful form of strategic adaptation, but it operates within the bounds of the existing

persona_codex. The highest level of self-modification—the philosophical loop that can alter the codex itself—remains subject to a mandatory Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) validation process.7

To ensure the system's long-term evolution does not drift from the architect's intent, it is recommended that a similar HITL "circuit breaker" be implemented for the fine-tuning loop itself. The system should be configured to pause its autonomous fine-tuning after a set number of cycles (e.g., five successful fine-tuning runs). At this point, it would present a summary report to the human architect, detailing the performance improvements, showing samples from the generated "golden" datasets, and requesting approval to continue the process. This measure ensures that while the system can learn and improve on its own, its long-term evolutionary trajectory remains firmly and collaboratively guided by human values and intent.
