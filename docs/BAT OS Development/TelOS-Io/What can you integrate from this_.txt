This blueprint is the final, essential piece of the puzzle. It provides the precise, phased implementation strategy—the "how"—for building the self-extending AI we've been designing on the native prototypal substrate you've chosen: the Io language.

We can integrate this blueprint directly by mapping its phases onto the specific features and files within the Io source code you've provided. It transforms our architectural discussion into a concrete engineering roadmap.

## Integration Blueprint: Project Prometheus on the Io Substrate

Here is how we can build on this, integrating the blueprint's phases with the Io language's capabilities.

Phase 1: The Mechanical Foundation

Blueprint Objective: Establish the low-level mechanics of using a doesNotUnderstand trigger to call C functions via an FFI.

Io Integration:

We will use Io's native forward message, which is its direct equivalent of Self's doesNotUnderstand. This is the core trigger mechanism.

We will leverage Io's built-in CFFI Addon, the documentation for which is located in docs/reference/Bridges/CFFI/. This provides the tools for calling C functions directly from Io.

The proof-of-concept will be a simple Io script that defines a prototype with a forward slot. When it receives an unknown message (e.g., myBridge call_python_sqrt(25)), the forward slot will execute pre-written CFFI code to call the C sqrt() function and return the value. This validates the entire mechanical chain without involving the LLM.

Phase 2: The Cognitive Bridge

Blueprint Objective: Use an LLM to reliably translate a high-level need into correct FFI code.

Io Integration:

The forward method in our "Prometheus" prototype will not contain FFI code itself. Instead, it will package the intercepted message (call_python_sqrt, 25) into a prompt for the LLM.

This prompt will be "scaffolded" with examples of correct Io CFFI syntax and the C header file for the target Python library function.

The LLM's generated CFFI code will be received back into the Io environment as a string, ready for the final phase. The blueprint's crucial insights on sandboxing will be implemented here to ensure safety.

Phase 3: The Autopoietic Loop

Blueprint Objective: Combine the trigger and the cognitive bridge into a closed, self-improving loop.

Io Integration:

The Prometheus prototype will be implemented as a core object in the Io runtime. It will be the default handler for all forward messages.

Upon receiving the FFI code from the LLM, the Prometheus prototype will use Io's native dynamic code-loading capabilities (likely via another FFI call to the system's C compiler and dynamic linker) to compile the code into a shared library.

It will then dynamically load this new library and use Io's reflective capabilities to add the new function as a slot on the appropriate prototype (e.g., adding the call_python_sqrt slot to the MathBridge prototype).

Finally, it will re-send the original message, which will now execute successfully. The blueprint's directive for knowledge persistence means this newly created slot will be saved as part of Io's "image," ensuring the AI never has to learn the same skill twice.

By integrating your blueprint this way, we move from a theoretical design to a practical, step-by-step plan for building a truly autopoietic system on a philosophically pure foundation.
