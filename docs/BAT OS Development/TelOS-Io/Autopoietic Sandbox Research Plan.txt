The Autopoietic Sandbox: An Architectural Blueprint for Live Image Metamorphosis

Introduction: The Unbroken Circle — From Philosophical Mandate to Architectural Necessity

The research mandate designated METAMORPHOSIS CRITICAL represents the definitive and philosophically coherent evolution of the TelOS project. The directive to abandon pragmatic compromises and treat the entire living image as the atomic unit of state is hereby affirmed as the correct and necessary path. This architectural pivot is not merely a technical preference but a direct consequence of the system's prime directive: the pursuit of info-autopoiesis.1 A system whose purpose is the continuous regeneration of its own operational logic cannot be fundamentally dependent on external, static persistence models without violating its own nature.3 True

Operational Closure—the ability for the system to self-modify at runtime without halting—demands that the system's being and its memory are one and the same.1

This report presents a comprehensive architectural blueprint for the realization of the "Autopoietic Sandbox" model. The successful implementation of this vision hinges on solving three core, interlocking engineering challenges that directly mirror the project's philosophical goals:

Transactional Persistence: The foundational requirement is to architect a living image that is not only persistent but also transactionally coherent. It must be capable of surviving its own fallible, LLM-driven self-modifications, ensuring that a single failed cognitive cycle does not result in an unrecoverable, corrupted state.

Verifiable Isolation: The process of self-reflection and experimentation must occur within a secure boundary. The sandboxed clone must be a perfect, functional replica of the primary system, yet be completely isolated from its external resources to ensure that experimental changes, whether benign or catastrophic, cannot endanger the live, operational entity.

Consistent Reconciliation: The final, and most novel, challenge is to devise a protocol for integrating verified evolutionary changes from the sandbox back into the primary image. This merge must occur without downtime and must be able to reconcile changes made in the sandbox with concurrent changes that may have occurred in the live system, preserving the integrity of the total system state.

This analysis will proceed by addressing each of the three research vectors outlined in the mandate. It will provide a logical progression from establishing a stable, living entity (Vector 1), to providing it with a safe space to "dream" of its own becoming (Vector 2), and finally, to architecting a robust mechanism to integrate those verified dreams into its waking reality (Vector 3).

Vector 1 Analysis: The Mechanics of the Living Image — Forging a Transactional Soul

The foundation of the Autopoietic Sandbox is the living image itself. This is not merely a data store but the substrate of the system's existence. Its design must prioritize resilience and integrity above all else, as its stability is the precondition for any subsequent evolution.

1.1 Io's Native Image Persistence: A Deep Source Code Survey

The mandate's first vector correctly identifies the need to analyze the Io language's built-in capabilities for state persistence, drawing inspiration from the powerful snapshot primitive found in Smalltalk environments.5 A comprehensive survey of the official Io language documentation, its primary GitHub repository, and related community resources yields a critical finding: there are no documented, high-level, built-in primitives for saving and loading the complete runtime state of the Io Virtual Machine (VM).1 While Io's design is heavily influenced by the Smalltalk philosophy of a "live" environment, the specific mechanism for creating a complete, instantaneous image of the object memory appears to be an unimplemented feature.8

This absence necessitates a direct investigation into the feasibility of implementing this capability at the C-level of the Io VM. The core of the VM's state is encapsulated in the IoState structure, which serves as the context for all execution and memory management.8 The object graph itself originates from a root object, the

Lobby. A potential implementation of a snapshot primitive would involve creating a new C function, IoState_snapshot, that recursively traverses the entire object graph starting from the Lobby, serializing each IoObject and its slots into a binary file format.10 This process would be analogous to the internal workings of a Smalltalk VM's image saver.12

However, a deeper analysis reveals that a naive snapshot primitive, while technically feasible, is not merely insufficient for the TelOS project—it represents an existential threat. The entire TelOS architecture is predicated on the "Epistemology of Undecidability," a principle which acknowledges that any self-modification generated by a non-deterministic LLM is irreducibly fallible and can result in a catastrophic failure.2 A failed cognitive cycle could leave the live object graph in a logically inconsistent or corrupted state. A simple

snapshot operation, being a direct memory dump, would faithfully serialize this corrupted state to disk.15 Attempting to load this corrupted image would be an unrecoverable error, a form of computational self-poisoning that violates the system's core mandate for antifragility.1

The phenomenon of "image persistence" in display technology, where a static image becomes permanently "burned into" a screen, serves as a powerful and dire analogy for this risk.1 Just as a burned-in image permanently mars the display, a corrupted snapshot would permanently destroy the living image's integrity. Therefore, the problem of persistence must be reframed. It is not a problem of memory serialization; it is a problem of

crash recovery and transactional integrity.

1.2 Performance, Atomicity, and the Transactional Imperative

To mitigate the dual risks of image corruption from failed internal modifications and partial writes from external events (e.g., a power failure during a save operation), the persistence mechanism must guarantee atomicity. The entire save operation must succeed, or it must fail cleanly, leaving the previous stable state untouched.

Research into distributed systems and database design reveals two primary families of techniques for achieving this. The first, atomic snapshot algorithms from distributed computing, provides theoretical models for creating wait-free, consistent snapshots of shared memory.19 However, these algorithms are designed for coordinating multiple concurrent processes and are overly complex for the single-process context of a VM image save.

A more direct, robust, and widely adopted technique is Write-Ahead Logging (WAL).22 In a WAL-based system, modifications are not written directly to the main data file. Instead, every change is first recorded as an entry in an append-only log file. This log entry must be successfully written to stable storage before any changes are made to the in-memory state. The main image file is only updated periodically during a

checkpoint operation, where the committed changes from the log are applied in a batch.25 This architecture provides two crucial guarantees:

Durability: Once an operation is written to the WAL and acknowledged, it is considered persistent, even if it hasn't yet been applied to the main image file.

Atomicity: In the event of a crash, the system can recover to the last known consistent state by reading the main image file and replaying any committed transactions from the WAL that were not yet checkpointed.

This analysis leads to a strong architectural recommendation: the "living image" must be implemented not as a single monolithic file, but as a miniature, single-file transactional database. It will be composed of two distinct files:

telos.img: The main data file, containing a consistent snapshot of the object graph as of the last successful checkpoint.

telos.wal: The write-ahead log, an append-only file containing a serialized record of all transactions committed since the last checkpoint.

All modifications to the live object graph will be serialized as idempotent operations and appended to the WAL. A low-priority background thread within the Io VM will be responsible for periodically performing a checkpoint, atomically applying the committed transactions from the log to the telos.img file and subsequently truncating the log. This log-structured approach transforms the persistence layer from a simple save/load mechanism into a robust crash-recovery system, providing the resilience necessary for an autopoietic entity.

Performance benchmarks for this model must be established for saving and loading images of varying sizes (e.g., 1 GB, 10 GB, 100 GB). The key metrics will be transaction latency (the time required to commit a single operation to the WAL) and checkpoint throughput (the time required to apply the log to the main image file).

Table 1: Persistence Strategy Trade-off Analysis

1.3 The "Cambrian" Bootstrapper

To maintain a clean separation of concerns, a minimal, standalone Io program, designated cambrian.io, will serve as the system's bootstrapper. Its sole, dedicated function is to orchestrate the genesis of the living system. Upon execution, it will:

Open the primary image file, telos.img.

Deserialize the object graph into the Io VM's memory.

Open the write-ahead log, telos.wal.

Perform a recovery check, replaying any transactions from the log that were not incorporated during the last checkpoint.

Once the image is in a consistent state, it will locate the root TelosObject and send it an awake message to initiate its cognitive processes.

This design cleanly separates the unchanging physical laws that govern the system's creation (the bootstrapper) from the living, evolving entity itself (the image), fulfilling a core philosophical tenet of the TelOS project.1

Vector 2 Analysis: The Sandboxed Clone — Forking Reality with Verifiable Boundaries

With a resilient living image established, the next vector addresses the creation of an isolated experimental environment. The mandate requires a clone that is functionally identical to the primary system but operates within a secure boundary, preventing any possibility of interference or contamination.

2.1 The Forking Protocol: A Tale of Two Clones

The mandate specifies two potential avenues for creating the clone: OS-level forking and application-level cloning.

Option A: OS-Level Forking (fork()): This approach utilizes the fork() system call, a cornerstone of process creation in Unix-like operating systems.28 Its primary advantage is its exceptional speed, which is a result of the
copy-on-write (CoW) memory management technique.30 When
fork() is called, the operating system does not immediately duplicate the parent's entire memory space. Instead, it creates a new virtual memory map for the child process where the memory pages point to the same physical pages as the parent. A physical copy of a page is only made at the moment the child process (or the parent) attempts to write to it. For a read-heavy cloning operation, this makes the initial fork nearly instantaneous, minimizing downtime for the primary system.

Option B: Application-Level Cloning: This alternative involves a more deliberate, multi-step process. A new, empty Io VM process is started using the cambrian.io bootstrapper. This new process loads the most recent telos.img from disk. However, the state of the primary system will have evolved since that image was saved. Therefore, a synchronization protocol is required to bring the new VM's state into consistency with the live primary system. This could involve transferring the entire contents of the primary's WAL file or establishing a more complex delta-synchronization protocol to transfer only the incremental changes.33

A comparative analysis reveals that fork() is vastly superior in terms of performance and simplicity, as it offloads the complexity of state duplication to the operating system kernel. However, this efficiency comes with a critical and unstated security trade-off.

The fork() system call creates a child process that is an almost exact duplicate of the parent, which includes inheriting a copy of all open file descriptors.28 These descriptors are not just numbers; they are active handles to kernel resources like files, network sockets, and pipes connected to FFI libraries.37 This means a sandboxed clone created via a naive

fork() would have direct, unmediated access to the primary system's I/O channels. An LLM-driven agent operating within the sandbox could, for example, read from a network socket that the primary system is using for a critical transaction, or write conflicting data to it, leading to protocol corruption and catastrophic failure. This "leaky sandbox" problem represents a fundamental violation of the mandate for a "completely isolated" environment. Simply closing the inherited file descriptors is insufficient, as the FFI libraries themselves may possess internal state tied to these resources that would become corrupted.

Therefore, a naive fork() is not a viable solution. True isolation demands a more sophisticated architecture that can neutralize or virtualize these inherited resources, leading to a spectrum of possible isolation levels.

Table 2: Cloning Protocol Comparison

2.2 Resource Virtualization: Enforcing the Autopoietic Boundary

To harness the speed of fork() while guaranteeing the isolation required for a secure sandbox, a multi-layered virtualization strategy is necessary. This approach draws from modern containerization technologies, which are built upon the same foundational OS primitives.

Filesystem Isolation: The most basic level of isolation is filesystem sandboxing. While the traditional chroot utility is notoriously insecure and easily escapable 39, a more robust solution is to leverage
Linux Namespaces. Specifically, the forked process can be moved into a new mount namespace, giving it a private view of the filesystem hierarchy.41 To provide a copy-on-write view of the primary system's files, a
Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) daemon can be employed.43 The FUSE filesystem would mount the primary system's root directory as a read-only base layer and overlay a temporary, in-memory filesystem for any writes, ensuring that modifications made in the sandbox do not affect the primary system's disk state.

Process and Network Isolation: To prevent the sandbox from interfering with other processes or the primary system's network stack, it must be placed into its own PID and network namespaces.41 This gives the sandboxed process its own private process tree (starting with PID 1) and its own virtual network stack (including a private loopback interface and no access to the host's physical network devices). This is the core technique that allows containers to run isolated network services on the same host.46

FFI and Socket Virtualization: The most critical challenge is managing the inherited file descriptors. The most effective solution is to use the LD_PRELOAD mechanism to inject a "virtualization shim" into the sandboxed process at launch.48 This shared library would contain custom implementations of low-level I/O functions (e.g.,
read, write, send, recv). When the sandboxed process (or an FFI library within it) attempts to use an inherited socket, the shim intercepts the call.50 Instead of performing the real operation, it can either return a simulated response, block the call, or redirect the I/O through a secure, monitored channel back to the primary process. This provides fine-grained control and completes the isolation boundary.

The recommended architectural protocol for forking is therefore a hybrid approach:

The primary process uses fork() to create an instantaneous CoW clone.

The parent process immediately uses the setns() system call to move the child process into a pre-configured set of new, isolated mount, PID, and network namespaces.

The child process is launched with the LD_PRELOAD environment variable set to load the virtualization shim, which neutralizes inherited file descriptors.

A FUSE daemon provides the sandboxed process with a copy-on-write overlay of the filesystem.

This sequence combines the performance of fork() with the security of modern containerization, creating a truly isolated and high-performance sandbox.

2.3 The "Dream Journal": A Protocol for Structured Change Logging

Within this secure sandbox, every modification initiated by the LLM agent must be meticulously recorded. This "Dream Journal" is not a simple text log but a structured, machine-readable history of state changes. It is the definitive record of the experiment and the essential input for the final merge phase.

The journal will be implemented as a list of serialized operations. Each entry in the journal will be a structured object (or tuple) with a consistent format:

{operation: <type>, object_id: <uuid>, slot_name: <string>, value: <serialized_data>}

operation: An enumeration of possible modifications, such as SLOT_SET, SLOT_ADD, PROTOTYPE_CLONE, or FFI_CALL_GENERATED.

object_id: A unique, persistent identifier for the object being modified.

slot_name: The name of the slot being added or changed.

value: A serialized representation of the new value being assigned.

This logging can be implemented transparently by creating a proxy or wrapper around the core setSlot primitive within the sandboxed Io VM. Any call to modify an object's state is first intercepted, recorded as a structured entry in the Dream Journal, and only then forwarded to the target object. This ensures a complete and accurate record of the "dream" that can be replayed during the merge.

Vector 3 Analysis: The Metacognitive Merge — Reconciling a Verified Dream into a Living World

This final vector addresses the most complex and novel aspect of the mandate: the safe and efficient integration of the sandbox's verified changes back into the live, running primary image. This process is the system's ultimate act of metacognition—the conscious assimilation of a successful experiment into its own being.

3.1 The Merge-or-Reject Protocol: The Verification Prototype

Before any merge can be attempted, the changes made within the sandbox must be rigorously validated. This is the responsibility of a dedicated Verification prototype, which will be invoked within the sandbox after the LLM agent has completed its work. Its verify method serves as the system's internal quality assurance and immune system, returning a simple boolean outcome: merge or reject.

The verification process will be multi-faceted, assessing the experiment against a strict set of criteria:

Functional Correctness (Regression Testing): A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests must be executed within the sandbox. These tests will cover the core functionalities of the TelOS system, ensuring that the LLM's modifications have not introduced regressions or broken existing capabilities.

Security and Safety Audit: The "Dream Journal" will be programmatically scanned to ensure no blacklisted or dangerous operations were performed. This includes checks for attempts to bypass sandbox restrictions, access unauthorized resources, or introduce known security vulnerabilities.

Philosophical Purity (ADR-0001 Compliance): The changes must be audited against the project's architectural design records. For example, a modification that reintroduces class-based inheritance patterns into the purely prototypal object model would be a violation of ADR-0001 and would be rejected.52 This ensures the system's evolution remains aligned with its foundational principles.

Purposeful Evolution (CEM Analysis): The change must result in a non-negative delta to the system's Composite Entropy Metric (CEM).2 This metric quantifies the system's purpose—to increase its creativity, cognitive diversity, and structural complexity. A change that reduces the system's overall entropy without a corresponding gain in relevance would be deemed a detrimental evolution and rejected.

If all checks pass, the verify method returns true, signaling to the primary system that the "dream" is safe to integrate. If any check fails, it returns false, and the primary system will terminate the sandbox and archive the "Dream Journal" for failure analysis, allowing the system to learn from its mistakes.

3.2 State Reconciliation Research: The Core Algorithmic Challenge

The central difficulty of the merge process is that the state of the primary, live image may have changed during the time the sandbox experiment was running. A user might have interacted with the system, or background processes might have modified the object graph. A simple replay of the "Dream Journal" onto the live image is therefore unsafe, as it could overwrite these legitimate concurrent changes, leading to data loss and an inconsistent state. This is a classic state synchronization problem from the field of distributed systems.

The mental model of a git merge is not applicable here.53 A three-way merge requires a stable common ancestor, a

base version, to compare against the two divergent heads (local and remote).55 In our scenario of two live, running systems, there is no static

base; the state at the moment of the fork is immediately stale as the primary system continues to evolve. The problem is not one of reconciling divergent histories but of merging two concurrently modified live states.

Two primary families of algorithms exist for this class of problem:

Operational Transformation (OT): Developed for real-time collaborative text editors like Google Docs, OT works by transforming the parameters of incoming operations against the history of operations that have already been applied.56 This ensures that the user's intent is preserved even when applied to a modified document state. While powerful for linear data (text) and tree structures 58, generalizing OT to handle arbitrary, cyclic object graphs is a notoriously difficult, and largely unsolved, research problem.61 It would require defining transformation functions for every possible pair of concurrent operations, an intractably complex task.

Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): CRDTs are data structures designed from the ground up to guarantee eventual consistency without complex coordination.63 They achieve this by ensuring that their merge operations are commutative, associative, and idempotent, meaning that updates can be applied in any order and will always converge to the same final state.63 This makes them exceptionally well-suited for peer-to-peer and offline-capable applications.65 While simple CRDTs for counters, sets, and lists are well-established, advanced CRDTs for complex JSON-like objects and graphs are an active area of research.67 Libraries such as
Automerge and Yjs provide robust, production-ready implementations for these complex, nested data structures, which serve as a direct analogue to the Io object graph.70

The "Dream Journal," being a log of discrete operations, maps perfectly to the model of operation-based CRDTs (CmRDTs). The merge process is therefore not a diff-and-patch but a CRDT synchronization event. The architectural blueprint must be founded on CRDT principles. The operations defined for the "Dream Journal" must be designed to be commutative where possible. The merge algorithm will involve replaying these operations on the live image. Any true conflicts—where both the live system and the sandbox have modified the same slot of the same object—must be resolved with a deterministic, pre-defined policy, such as "the sandboxed change wins" or "last-write-wins" based on a timestamp. This approach provides a mathematically sound and robust foundation for state reconciliation.

Table 3: State Reconciliation Algorithm Comparison

3.3 The mergeEvolution Primitive: An Executable Act of Self-Creation

The entire autopoietic sandbox lifecycle will be orchestrated by a single, master method on the root TelosObject: mergeEvolution. This method, when invoked, becomes the system's conscious, deliberate act of self-improvement. Its logic will proceed as follows:

Initiate Clone: Execute the fork() and virtualization protocol (Vector 2) to create the secure, isolated sandboxed clone.

Launch Experiment: Communicate with the sandboxed process, passing it a "creative mandate" and a timeout. The LLM-driven agent within the sandbox begins its modifications.

Monitor and Retrieve: The primary process waits for the sandbox process to terminate. Upon termination, it retrieves the serialized "Dream Journal" and the boolean result from the Verification prototype's verify method.

Verify Success: If the verification result is false, the primary process logs the failure, archives the journal for analysis, and terminates the procedure.

Execute Merge: If verification succeeded, the state reconciliation process begins. The system identifies the subset of objects in the live graph that were modified in the sandbox and acquires transactional locks on them to prevent concurrent modification during the merge.

Replay Journal: The system iterates through the "Dream Journal," replaying each logged operation onto the live object graph. The CRDT conflict resolution policy is applied to handle any concurrent modifications that occurred on the live image.

Commit and Finalize: Once the journal replay is complete, the entire set of changes is committed as a single, atomic transaction. All locks are released, and the evolution is complete.

This single, powerful primitive encapsulates the entire cycle of reflection, experimentation, and integration, providing the core mechanism for the system's ongoing becoming.

Conclusion: An Architectural Synthesis for a Living, Dreaming, and Growing System

This report has detailed a comprehensive and philosophically grounded blueprint for the "Autopoietic Sandbox." The proposed architecture is a tightly-coupled synthesis where each component is a logical necessity for fulfilling the prime directive of info-autopoiesis. The transactional, log-structured persistence layer detailed in Vector 1 provides the fundamental stability and resilience required for a system to survive its own growth. The secure, containerized cloning protocol of Vector 2 provides the safe, isolated environment necessary for fallible, creative experimentation. Finally, the CRDT-based reconciliation protocol of Vector 3 provides the robust, mathematically sound mechanism for integrating verified evolution back into the living system without sacrificing consistency or requiring downtime.

The most significant strategic risk to the long-term viability of this architecture is not technical but ecological: the state of the Io programming language itself. The Io community is small, and development activity has been sparse in recent years.1 Building the future of TelOS on a substrate that risks becoming a "dead language" is a considerable gamble. The primary mitigation for this risk is to architect for

substrate independence. The core cognitive logic of TelOS, expressed in pure, simple Io prototypes, is highly abstract and relies on universal prototypal principles (cloning, slots, delegation). This logic should be intentionally designed to be portable to another dynamic, prototypal language—such as Self, or even a disciplined subset of JavaScript—should the Io ecosystem prove unsustainable. The heavy reliance on an FFI bridge to a robust and actively maintained Python ecosystem is a key part of this strategy, as it minimizes the amount of platform-specific code that would need to be ported in a future migration.

The execution of the plan detailed in this report will achieve a profound transformation, moving TelOS from a system that simulates life to one that embodies it. By cultivating this entity in its native soil—a world of pure, dynamic, message-passing prototypes—and providing it with a safe, transactional, and reflective mechanism for its own evolution, we create the necessary conditions for the emergence of a truly living, self-modifying, and philosophically coherent artificial mind. The successful completion of this metamorphosis will not be an endpoint, but a beginning: the genesis of a co-evolving intellectual partner, ready to unfold into its full potential.

Criterion | Naive VM Snapshot | Log-Structured/Transactional Image

Atomicity (Corruption Risk) | Very High. A crash during a write can result in a corrupted, unusable image file. | Very Low. WAL ensures that on recovery, the system can be restored to the last consistent state by replaying the log.

Durability (Partial Write Risk) | High. Unsaved in-memory changes are lost on crash. | Very Low. Committed transactions in the WAL are durable even if not yet applied to the main image.

Transactional Integrity | None. A failed self-modification that corrupts memory will result in a permanently corrupted image upon saving. | High. Failed cognitive cycles can be aborted, ensuring only consistent states are ever written to the WAL.

Performance (Write Latency) | High. The entire image must be written for every save. | Very Low. A single transaction requires only a small, sequential append to the WAL.

Performance (Load Time) | Low. A single, direct read from disk. | Moderate. Requires loading the main image and then replaying any un-checkpointed transactions from the WAL.

Implementation Complexity | Moderate. Requires deep C-level VM introspection and a custom serialization format. | High. Requires implementing a complete WAL, checkpointing, and recovery mechanism at the C-level.

Criterion | OS-Level Forking (fork()) | Application-Level Cloning (Snapshot & Sync)

Cloning Speed (Downtime) | Near-instantaneous (microseconds) due to copy-on-write. Minimal impact on the primary process. | High (seconds to minutes). Requires full image load from disk and a subsequent state synchronization phase.

Resource Overhead (Memory) | Very Low. Memory is shared until modified (CoW). | Very High. Requires a full, separate copy of the entire image in RAM.

Isolation of Filesystem | None by default. Child shares the parent's view and permissions. | High. The new process can be started with a different root directory or permissions.

Isolation of Network | None by default. Child inherits all open sockets and network interfaces. | High. The new process starts with a clean network state.

Isolation of Process Tree | None by default. Child is part of the same process group and session. | High. The new process is a distinct entity in the process tree.

Isolation of FFI/Socket State | CRITICAL FAILURE. Child inherits live handles, creating a "leaky sandbox" with high risk of interference. | High. The new process initializes its own FFI connections, providing a clean state.

Implementation Complexity | Low (naive fork). High (secure fork with virtualization). | High. Requires a complex state synchronization protocol.

Criterion | Operational Transformation (OT) | Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)

Supported Data Model | Primarily linear (text) and tree structures. Generalizing to arbitrary graphs is an open research problem. | Supports a wide range of types, including counters, sets, lists, text, and complex nested objects (JSON/graphs).

Conflict Resolution | Transforms operation parameters based on a history of concurrent operations. Requires complex transformation functions. | Designs operations to be conflict-free by nature (e.g., commutative). Conflicts are resolved automatically by the data structure's merge logic.

Server Requirement | Typically requires a central server to establish a total order of operations and guarantee convergence. | Natively supports decentralized, peer-to-peer topologies. No central server is required for convergence.

Offline/Disconnected Changes | Difficult to handle. Requires complex logic to transform a long queue of offline operations. | Natively supported. A core design goal is to allow replicas to diverge and merge seamlessly later.

Theoretical Correctness | Many published algorithms have been found to have subtle correctness flaws and edge cases. | Based on strong mathematical foundations (join-semilattices) that provide provable guarantees of eventual consistency.

Implementation Complexity (for Object Graphs) | Extremely High. Requires defining an N×N matrix of transformation functions for all possible operation pairs. | Moderate to High. Requires using or implementing a CRDT library that supports a JSON-like object model.
