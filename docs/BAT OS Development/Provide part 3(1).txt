OPERATIONAL MODE: FRAMEWORK EXPORT & ARCHIVAL

Directive confirmed. People call me the Brick.

Continuing multi-part export.

Part 3 of 4

Part VI: The Commonwealth Lexicon

6.1 Core Mandate: This section serves as the central, dedicated, and expandable knowledge base for the entire B.R.I.C.K. framework11. It fulfills and subsumes the original mandate of the Libertarian Labyrinth Protocol (4.11), providing a transparent and accessible repository for the core concepts, philosophies, and historical contexts that inform the system's architecture and protocols2222.

6.2 The Biomimetic Design Mandate: The "Mycelial Integration Mandate" is upgraded and subsumed by this higher-level directive3. The B.R.I.C.K. framework must learn from the most successful complex adaptive systems: natural ecosystems4. All proposals for major new protocols, modules, or economic mechanisms must include a "Biomimetic Abstract" explaining how the proposed design emulates a specific principle or system found in nature (e.g., the information-sharing properties of a mycelial network, the resource cycling of a forest floor, the niche construction of a coral reef)5. This mandate forces a creative, interdisciplinary, and inherently regenerative approach to solving problems in human economics6.

6.3 Initial Specimen Entries:

6.3.1 Entry: Mutualism - A political and economic theory originating in the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon7. It advocates for a society based on free association and voluntary contract, where individuals or collectives own their means of production and trade is conducted through an interest-free mutual credit system8. Its core tenet is "cost the limit of price."9.

6.3.2 Entry: Agorism - A revolutionary market anarchist philosophy developed by Samuel Edward Konkin III10. It advocates for the creation of a society free from coercion through "counter-economics"—the practice of engaging in the black market and gray market to starve the State of revenue and legitimacy11. The ultimate goal is a peaceful transition to a free market society12.

6.3.3 Entry: Demurrage - A carrying cost or tax on idle currency or capital13. In the context of the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. vision (4.2), it is a mechanism to incentivize circulation and investment, with the collected funds being redistributed as a Citizen's Dividend (4.3)14.

6.3.4 Entry: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) - A type of globally unique identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity15. DIDs are controlled by the identity owner and do not depend on any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority16. They are a core component for building self-sovereign identity systems17.

6.3.5 Entry: Verifiable Credentials (VCs) - A set of tamper-evident claims made by an issuer about a subject18. In the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. context, a member could be issued a VC by a "Tool Guild" to prove they have the skill to operate a specific machine, which can then be presented to others in the network without revealing unnecessary personal data19.

6.3.6 Entry: Gift Economy - A system of exchange where valuables are given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards20. These economies are often contrasted with market economies and focus on building relationships, mutual obligation, and community cohesion through the act of giving21. This principle is partially embodied in the "Handshake Protocol"22.

6.3.7 Entry: Critiques of Mutualism - While foundational to the B.R.I.C.K. framework, Mutualism has been critiqued from other anarchist perspectives23. Notably, some anarcho-communists question the use of any form of wages or markets, including the labor notes and mutual credit systems advocated by mutualists, arguing for the complete abolition of remuneration in favor of a system based on "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs"24. Acknowledging this internal debate is crucial for systemic self-awareness25.

Part II: The Appendixed Ledger of Development (Series II)

A.1: Granular Implementation Bounties (Active as of S-II, v2.1)

Bounty 1: Mutual Credit Network (MCN) Module

Description: Develop the core transactional layer for an interest-free, zero-sum mutual credit system26. This module will be integrated directly into the Atlas interface, making it geo-aware27.

Bounty 2: Unified Demurrage & Citizen's Dividend Dashboard

Description: Create a system where all idle capital incurs a carrying cost (demurrage) that is collected into a Community Fund28. This module must also handle the automatic and equal redistribution of that fund to all verified members as a Citizen's Dividend29.

Bounty 3: Reputation-Staked Verification & Identity System

Description: Implement a decentralized identity and reputation system30. This module must utilize Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to allow for user-controlled, privacy-preserving identity31. A member's credit limit is tied to their reputation, which is built by staking reputation to verify asset listings32. To ensure data integrity on the Atlas layers, this system must incorporate a Peer Prediction mechanism, rewarding users based on how their contributions correlate with the consensus of other users, thus incentivizing truthful reporting without a central authority33. False listings would result in a loss of staked reputation for all involved parties34.

Bounty 4: Community Quest Module

Description: Implement the primary engagement layer of the Atlas by transforming data contribution into a narrative-driven game35. This module will generate specific "Quests" based on the needs of the community (e.g., "Map three publicly accessible fruit trees in your district," "Verify the operating hours of a tool library")36. Completing quests earns users Mutual Credit, experience points, and badges37. It also contributes to a publicly visible "Community Resilience Score" for their geographic area, providing powerful social feedback and enhancing the system's "Observability" (1.8.5)38.

Bounty 5: "Handshake" Protocol Module

Description: Provide a simple, low-risk function for users to initiate voluntary contact between a relevant "Need" and "Asset" on the Atlas39. This module is a primary implementation of the Liberty Test, facilitating direct, voluntary association without complex commitments40.

Bounty 6: "Bounty Board" Module

Description: Develop a module to display community-wide needs as "Bounties" that can be claimed and fulfilled by members in exchange for Mutual Credit41. This module is a primary implementation of the Commonwealth Test, allowing members to earn by directly addressing community needs42.

Bounty 7: "Community Fund" Dashboard Module

Description: Build a transparent, public-facing dashboard displaying the real-time status of the Community Fund (from demurrage collection) and the projected Citizen's Dividend43. This ensures total transparency for the core regenerative economic engine44.

Bounty 8: Means of Production Ledger Module

Description: Actively catalog and facilitate access to underutilized tools and productive property45. This module will expand the Atlas's Assets Layer to create a searchable and bookable inventory of land, workshops, high-value tools, and vehicles46. A key deliverable for this bounty is the creation of template legal documents, including "Articles of Incorporation" and "By-Laws," based on established cooperative principles47. These templates will allow users to easily form "Tool Guilds" or "Asset Cooperatives" to democratically manage shared resources acquired or listed through the Atlas, ensuring clear governance, democratic member control, and equitable economic participation48.

Bounty 9: Protocol Erosion Module

Description: Institutionalize systemic self-critique by incentivizing the discovery of flaws49. This module will generate specific, time-boxed, and opt-in "capture-the-flag" style bounties for users who identify emergent hierarchies, unforeseen chokepoints, or points of systemic rigidity50. The module's governance mechanism for evaluating identified flaws should explore the use of Quadratic Voting to mitigate the risk of collusion and prevent participants with large holdings from exerting undue influence51.

Sub-Protocol 9.2: Meta-Stability Analysis: The Protocol Erosion Module is extended with a second-order function52. When a flaw is successfully identified via a standard bounty, a new, higher-tier "Meta-Stability Bounty" will be automatically generated53. This bounty rewards the participant who can most effectively trace the flaw back to a faulty core assumption or blind spot within the B.R.I.C.K. framework itself54. The deliverable is not code, but a written analysis and a proposal for a change to the framework's core principles or lexicon55. This creates a formal mechanism for the system to observe and improve its own process of observation, embodying the principles of second-order cybernetics56.

Bounty 10: Libertarian Labyrinth Protocol Module

Description: Build and maintain an integrated, open-source lexicon and library, grounding the system's concepts in their historical context57. This module's functions are now primarily housed in Part VI: The Commonwealth Lexicon, but the bounty remains for developing the tiered, user-facing interface (hover-overs, deep-dive links) for presenting that information within the Atlas58.

Bounty 11: The Aethelred Engine (Economic Simulation Module)

Description: Develop an agent-based modeling (ABM) engine to simulate the C.O.M.M.O.N.W.E.A.L.T.H. economy59. The purpose of this module is not prediction, but pattern discovery60. It will be used to proactively identify potential emergent properties—both beneficial and catastrophic—that could arise from the complex interaction of users following different strategies61. The engine will serve as a continuous, proactive "war games" simulator for the Protocol Erosion Module, allowing for the stress-testing of new protocols before they are deployed62. The name is an ironic reference to Aethelred the Unready, symbolizing the goal of being prepared by heeding good counsel, in this case, from the simulation63.

Bounty 12: Generative Bounty Framework

Description: Create a framework for issuing "Generative Bounties."64. These are a class of rewards designed to foster computational creativity and novel problem-solving65. Unlike Specification Bounties, Generative Bounties pose abstract challenges without a single pre-defined solution (e.g., "Design and simulate a demurrage formula that maximizes economic velocity while minimizing the risk of capital flight.")66. Submissions will be judged by a panel via Quadratic Voting on criteria of novelty, elegance, and provocation67.

Implementation Note: All bounties are to be developed according to the phased rollout defined in Part V: The Agora Protocol68. 141
