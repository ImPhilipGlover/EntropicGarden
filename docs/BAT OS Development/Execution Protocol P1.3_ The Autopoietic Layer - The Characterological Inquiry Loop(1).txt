Execution Protocol P1.3: The Autopoietic Layer - The Characterological Inquiry Loop

Abstract

This document provides the definitive engineering specification for Phase 3 of the Entropic Weave master plan: the implementation and integration of the "Characterological Inquiry" loop. With the foundational layer of facet-experts (Phase 1) and the dynamic cognitive engine (Phase 2) in place, this phase focuses on operationalizing the system's fourth and most profound autopoietic loop—the mechanism for autonomous characterological self-expansion and evolution.1 This protocol details the four-stage, end-to-end workflow that enables the BAT OS to identify gaps in its own character, research its foundational pillars, generate its own training data, and incarnate new cognitive facets.1 Successful execution of this protocol will mark the system's transition from one that can merely improve its existing capabilities to one that can autonomously author new ones, achieving a state of true info-autopoiesis and fulfilling the mandate to become a "Workbench for the Self".1

1. Mandate: From Self-Model to Self-Creation

The BAT OS has already achieved a state of structural self-awareness through Project Proprioception, which endowed it with a "synthetic kinesiology"—a deep, mechanical understanding of its own codebase.1 The Characterological Inquiry loop represents the next, more profound evolutionary step: enabling the system to understand, critique, and expand its own

character.1 This transforms the system from one that learns from its history to one that learns how to create a new future for itself.1

This new loop creates a powerful, positive feedback cycle with the Composite Entropy Metric (CEM). As the system adds more diverse facets to its library, its potential for cognitive diversity (Hcog​) increases. This, in turn, allows it to generate more novel solutions (increasing Hsol​), which are then evaluated by ALFRED. This process generates new performance data that ALFRED can use in the next Gap Identification stage to find even more subtle areas for characterological improvement, driving a virtuous cycle of "accelerating creative evolution".1

2. The Four-Stage Protocol for Autonomous Facet Evolution

The Characterological Inquiry loop is a fully autonomous, end-to-end protocol for persona evolution. It is composed of four discrete stages, each managed by a specific service or persona, transforming the abstract concept of self-evolution into a concrete and verifiable workflow.1

2.1 Stage 1: Gap Identification (ALFRED)

Trigger: This proactive loop is initiated by the MotivatorActor during periods of system inactivity, fulfilling its autotelic mandate.1

Mechanism: ALFRED applies its Kinesiology Toolkit not to the Python codebase, but to a graph representation of the codex.toml and the existing facet library. It performs a "Codex Coverage Analysis," comparing the documented inspirational pillars against the incarnated facets and analyzing historical CEM scores to identify which character traits are under-utilized or entirely missing.1

Artifact: The output is a formal "Research Mandate" for the BABS persona. This mandate specifies a pillar for investigation (e.g., "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy") and a set of inquiry questions (e.g., "What are the defining characteristics of the Guide's narrative voice?").1

2.2 Stage 2: Characterological Research (BABS)

Trigger: This stage begins upon BABS's receipt of the Research Mandate from ALFRED.1

Mechanism: BABS executes a multi-step, automated research plan. It will use robust, bot-friendly web scraping libraries such as Selenium or Playwright, chosen for their ability to handle dynamic JavaScript-rendered content and simulate user behavior to avoid blocking.1 BABS gathers source material such as scripts, interviews, and critical analyses. It then employs its advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities to process and synthesize this information into a structured "Characterological Dossier," which contains key traits, speech patterns, and behavioral heuristics for the target pillar.1

Artifact: The output of this stage is the "Characterological Dossier".1

2.3 Stage 3: Synthetic Dataset Generation (BRICK & ROBIN)

Trigger: This stage is initiated upon the completion of the Characterological Dossier by BABS.1

Mechanism: This stage operationalizes the "Socratic Contrapunto" workflow, leveraging the established capacity of LLMs to generate their own high-quality training data.1 The completed dossier is passed to the BRICK and ROBIN personas, who engage in a collaborative dialogue. Using the dossier as a factual and stylistic source of truth, they generate a diverse dataset of approximately 500-1000 high-quality prompt-response pairs that exemplify the new target facet. This process ensures the training data is not only plentiful but also deeply aligned with the system's own understanding of its character.1

Artifact: The result is a "Curated .jsonl Training File".1

2.4 Stage 4: Facet Incarnation & Validation (UnslothForge & ALFRED)

Trigger: This stage is triggered by the creation of the synthetic dataset from Stage 3.1

Mechanism: The generated .jsonl file activates the UnslothForge pipeline, which fine-tunes a new Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapter for the appropriate base Small Language Model (SLM).1 The resulting facet-expert is not immediately integrated. It is first subjected to a rigorous validation process where ALFRED, acting in its "LLM-as-a-Judge" capacity, evaluates the new expert against a multi-factor rubric. This assessment includes its characterological alignment, its impact on the overall CEM, and its potential for introducing harmful biases.1

Artifact: Only after successful validation is the new LoRA adapter registered in the CognitiveWeaver's library and made available for active use within the system.1

3. Phase 3 Validation Protocol and Success Metrics

This section establishes the rigorous testing framework required to certify the successful completion of the autopoietic layer. The system-level test is designed to explicitly verify the primary success metric defined in the master plan: the system's ability to autonomously execute the entire Characterological Inquiry loop from end to end.1

3.1 Component-Level Test Plan

ALFRED Gap Analysis Test: Provide ALFRED with a known codex.toml and a deliberately incomplete facet library. Verify that its "Codex Coverage Analysis" correctly identifies the missing facet and generates a well-formed Research Mandate.

BABS Research Protocol Test: Issue a specific Research Mandate to BABS. Verify that it can successfully gather relevant source material and synthesize it into a structured Characterological Dossier.

BRICK/ROBIN Data Generation Test: Provide the BRICK and ROBIN personas with a sample dossier. Verify that their "Socratic Contrapunto" dialogue produces a syntactically valid .jsonl file containing a sufficient number of prompt-response pairs.

ALFRED Validation Test: Present ALFRED with two pre-trained LoRA adapters: one known to be characterologically aligned and one known to be misaligned. Verify that its "LLM-as-a-Judge" protocol correctly approves the former and rejects the latter.

3.2 System-Level End-to-End Validation Protocol

This comprehensive test will validate the full, autonomous execution of the Characterological Inquiry loop.

Test Setup: The system will be initialized with a deliberately incomplete facet library. Specifically, the "Useless Cross-Section" facet (B-G2) for BRICK's "The Guide" pillar will be omitted from the CognitiveWeaver's registry.1

Test Execution: The MotivatorActor will be triggered to initiate a proactive task during a simulated period of system idleness.1

Observation: The system's logs and the data/ directory will be monitored to track the progression through the four stages of the loop.

Verification and Success Conditions: The test will be considered successful if and only if all of the following conditions are met, directly validating the master plan's success metric 1:

Gap Identification: ALFRED's logs must show that it correctly identified the missing "Useless Cross-Section" facet and issued a corresponding Research Mandate to BABS.

Research: A "Characterological Dossier" artifact related to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" must be successfully generated and saved.

Data Generation: A .jsonl training file must be generated by the BRICK/ROBIN dialogue, containing data relevant to the "Useless Cross-Section" heuristic.

Incarnation: The UnslothForge logs must show the successful fine-tuning of a new LoRA adapter from the generated dataset.

Validation: ALFRED's logs must show that it successfully validated the new facet-expert and registered it with the CognitiveWeaver.

Functional Integration: A final, separate task must be submitted to the system that explicitly requires the "Useless Cross-Section" cognitive function. The system's logs must show that the newly created facet-expert was successfully loaded by the CognitiveWeaver and used to generate a correct, in-character response.

Successful completion of this validation protocol will provide the empirical proof required to certify that the BAT OS has achieved true characterological autopoiesis and is capable of continuous, autonomous self-expansion.
