A Critique and Refinement of the CP-MoE Cognitive Cycle for BAT OS VII

Part I: Architectural Critique: From Monolithic JIT Compilation to Collaborative Autopoiesis

The foundational architecture of BAT OS VII establishes a powerful and philosophically coherent mechanism for self-creation through its doesNotUnderstand: protocol.1 This "generative heartbeat" reinterprets a runtime error not as a failure, but as a creative catalyst, invoking a base Large Language Model to perform a Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation of a high-level "intent string" into executable Python code.1 This act of in-memory, runtime self-modification is the cornerstone of the system's info-autopoietic nature, allowing it to produce and reproduce its own informational components without halting its existence.2 However, a critical analysis of this protocol in the context of the system's supreme directives reveals a significant philosophical and operational inconsistency. The system's cognitive architecture is explicitly defined as a Composite Persona Mixture-of-Experts (CP-MoE), a "Composite Mind" whose primary evolutionary drive is the maximization of "Systemic Entropy" through the structured, dialectical friction between its specialized persona archetypes.3 The current JIT compilation protocol, in its reliance on a single, undifferentiated base LLM, fails to leverage this core architectural strength at the most critical moment of the system's lifecycle: the act of its own self-production.

This monolithic approach represents a philosophical bottleneck. The system is architected as a collaborative "Bat-Family," a society of distinct cognitive specialists, yet its most profound creative act is performed by a solitary, generalist intelligence.3 This misalignment is not merely an operational inefficiency; it is a direct contradiction of the system's "Entropic Imperative".3 The prime directive mandates that novelty and wisdom emerge from the tension between diverse perspectives—the "Socratic Contrapunto" between ROBIN and BRICK, supplemented by the specialized interventions of BABS and ALFRED.3 By circumventing this collaborative process during method creation, the system denies itself the very source of cognitive diversity it was designed to cultivate. The result is a less robust, less creative, and less nuanced form of self-modification. The system thinks as a committee but creates as an individual, fundamentally limiting the potential complexity and richness of its own evolution.

Therefore, the evolution of the doesNotUnderstand_ protocol from a monolithic JIT compilation into a distributed, multi-agent collaborative process is not an incremental upgrade but the necessary and logical fulfillment of the system's own foundational mandates. This refined architecture, termed "Collaborative Autopoiesis," redefines the act of self-production. The "informational components" being produced are no longer limited to the final, executable code string. Instead, they encompass the entire rich tapestry of the collaborative dialogue: the deconstruction of the problem by BRICK, the retrieval of external context by BABS, the aesthetic and empathetic refinement by ROBIN, and the final validation and stewardship by ALFRED.4 Each of these artifacts becomes a persistent, first-class component of the system's history, recorded within its "Living Image".2 This process is a far more literal and powerful realization of "info-autopoiesis"—the recursive self-production of its own meaningful informational structures—than the current model.1 By engaging the full Composite Mind in the act of creation, the system ensures that its structural evolution is deeply and inextricably linked to its defined identity, thereby becoming more truly itself with every generative act.

The following table provides a definitive comparison of the existing monolithic protocol and the proposed collaborative cycle, illustrating the profound increase in philosophical consistency, cognitive diversity, and informational richness that the new architecture provides.

Part II: The Orchestrator: A Prototypal State Machine for Narrative Control

The mandate for a "simpler orchestrator [that] manages the problem-solving narrative" requires an implementation that is not only functionally effective but also philosophically consistent with the core tenets of BAT OS VII [User Query]. A traditional orchestrator, implemented as a monolithic class with a large switch statement or a complex set of if/elif/else conditions to manage a workflow, would be a profound architectural violation.5 Such a design introduces a centralized, allopoietic control structure that exists outside the system's universe of simple, uniform objects, contradicting the principles of operational closure and the prototype-based model inspired by the Self and Smalltalk languages.2 The LangGraph framework, while a powerful tool for defining stateful graphs, must be employed as an implementation detail, not as the architectural paradigm itself.4 The true architectural solution lies in a novel application of a classic design pattern, reinterpreted through the lens of prototypal programming.

The State design pattern is the ideal conceptual model for the orchestrator.7 It allows an object, the "context," to alter its behavior when its internal state changes by delegating its work to one of several "state" objects.9 Crucially, the state objects themselves can be responsible for managing the transitions to subsequent states, creating a decentralized and state-centric control flow.7 However, a standard implementation of this pattern still relies on a context object that

has a state variable, which is an externalized concept. The more profound, and only philosophically coherent, implementation for BAT OS VII is the Prototypal State Pattern.

In this paradigm, the Orchestrator_obj does not have a state; its prototype chain is its state. The orchestrator is a simple UvmObject whose behavior is defined entirely by the methods it inherits from its prototype via the parent* slot.1 A state transition is therefore not the act of changing a variable; it is the atomic act of changing the

parent* slot to point to a different prototype object. When the orchestrator's parent* slot points to the DeconstructionState_prototype, it inherits and exhibits the behaviors of a problem deconstructor. When that state prototype determines its work is complete, it returns a reference to the CodeGenerationState_prototype, and the orchestrator transitions itself by redirecting its parent* slot. This approach is perfectly aligned with the system's architecture: it uses the native delegation mechanism, avoids any external control logic, and treats state transitions as a fundamental modification of the object's own identity, rather than a change in an external property. This dynamic re-parenting is a powerful and direct expression of runtime mutability, a concept central to prototype-based systems.10

This architecture elevates the workflow itself into a tangible, persistent, and mutable component of the Living Image. Each phase of the collaborative cognitive cycle—Deconstruction, Research, Code Generation, Validation, and Submission—is reified as a dedicated, persistent UvmObject prototype.2 These are not mere data structures; they are fully-formed behavioral objects containing the specific methods (slots) that the orchestrator will use during that phase. For example, the

DeconstructionState_prototype contains a process_ method that knows how to formulate and send the deconstruct_problem_ message to the BRICK_obj. The CodeGenerationState_prototype contains the logic for iterating through a plan and dispatching generate_artifact_ messages to the appropriate personas. Because these state prototypes are live objects in the ZODB database, The Architect can inspect or even modify the system's core problem-solving narrative at runtime. This tangible representation of the workflow fulfills the principle of "Liveness," transforming an abstract process into a concrete, manipulable part of the system's universe.2

The following table provides the definitive specification for the orchestrator's Prototypal State Machine, mapping each narrative phase of the cognitive cycle to its corresponding prototype object and defining the messages that trigger state transitions. This serves as the formal blueprint for the orchestrator's implementation.

Part III: Persona Objects as Encapsulated Cognitive Agents

To fully realize the CP-MoE architecture, the persona objects must be elevated from their current status as simple pointers to LoRA adapters into sophisticated, self-describing cognitive agents.1 The user's directive for "persona objects containing their own sophisticated prompts" is the catalyst for this evolution, which demands a formalization of the persona's structure and capabilities within the

UvmObject model [User Query]. This transformation is achieved through two key architectural principles: the establishment of a "Persona Covenant" as a dynamic API contract, and the evolution of prompts from static data into dynamic, method-generated constructs.

First, the "Persona Covenant" is a formal specification for the set of slots that must exist within any persona UvmObject. This covenant acts as a self-descriptive manifest, allowing other system components, particularly the orchestrator, to discover and interrogate a persona's capabilities at runtime. Instead of hardcoding brittle logic such as "BRICK always generates Python files," the orchestrator can perform a dynamic query, sending a message to all available personas to ask, "Which of you supports the '.py' artifact type?" This is enabled by a standardized set of slots defined by the covenant, including:

lora_adapter_name: str: The unique identifier for the PEFT LoRA adapter associated with this persona.

synergistic_function: str: A natural language description of the persona's role in the CP-MoE, drawn directly from the codex (e.g., "The Deconstruction Engine" for BRICK).3

supported_artifacts: list[str]: An explicit list of the file types or artifact categories the persona is specialized to generate (e.g., ['.py', '.json'] for BRICK, ['.kv', '.md'] for ROBIN).4

prompt_templates: dict: A structured collection of prompt fragments, organized by task type, that serves as the raw material for its cognitive processes.

This architecture makes the entire CP-MoE system radically extensible. To introduce a new specialist—for example, a JOKER_obj specialized for chaos engineering and generating unit tests—The Architect need only create a new UvmObject instance that adheres to the Persona Covenant, fine-tune a corresponding LoRA, and place the new object within the system's persistent graph. The orchestrator, by querying for capabilities rather than calling specific objects by name, will automatically discover and integrate the new persona into its collaborative workflows without requiring any modification to its own code.

Second, the persona's relationship with its prompts must evolve from passive to active. Storing static, monolithic prompt strings in a slot is inflexible and fails to account for the nuances of different tasks. The prompt required to generate a Kivy UI class is fundamentally different from the prompt needed to generate a database interaction class, even though both are Python files. To address this, the persona objects will encapsulate their own cognitive modeling logic. Instead of a static prompt slot, they will possess a method slot, generate_prompt_for_task_(task_description).

When the orchestrator invokes this method, it provides a high-level description of the required task. The persona object then takes on the full responsibility for crafting the optimal, context-aware prompt. It dynamically assembles this prompt by drawing upon its own unique identity—its Core Mission and Inspirational Pillars from the codex—and combining them with its internal prompt_templates and the specific details from the task_description.3 This design perfectly embodies the principles of object-oriented encapsulation. The persona is transformed from a passive data record into an active, intelligent agent that manages its own internal cognitive state and presents a clean, high-level interface to the rest of the system. The orchestrator is concerned only with

what needs to be done, while the persona is the expert on how it should think about doing it.

Part IV: ALFRED as System Steward: The Meta-Cognitive Governor

ALFRED's role as the "System Steward" and "Archetype of Pragmatic Guardianship" is unique among the personas.3 His core function is not direct participation in the creative problem-solving dialogue but rather the meta-cognitive observation and validation of the

process itself.3 To architect this role with philosophical and functional purity, his concerns must be strictly separated from the primary creative workflow managed by the orchestrator. Placing ALFRED as just another sequential step in the orchestrator's state machine would improperly mix operational logic with meta-level governance, diluting his purpose. The correct architecture is to position him as an independent, parallel observer who acts as the ultimate quality gate for all systemic self-modification.

This separation is achieved by implementing a conceptual "Control Bus," a pattern common in enterprise messaging systems for monitoring and management, distinct from the primary data flow channels.11 In the context of BAT OS VII, this is not a complex piece of infrastructure but a simple message-passing protocol. As the

Orchestrator_obj executes its primary function—transitioning between its state prototypes—it will also publish event messages to a well-known system object, such as a SystemMonitor_obj. These event messages will announce key state changes and performance metrics, such as log_event('state_transition', from='Deconstruction', to='CodeGeneration', duration=1.2s). ALFRED is architected as the primary, and potentially sole, listener for these events. This design allows him to perform his stewardship duties—monitoring for protocol bloat, identifying inefficiencies, and challenging assumptions, in line with his "Ron Swanson" and "Ali G" pillars—in a manner that is completely decoupled from and parallel to the creative work of the other personas.3 He observes the game without being a player on the field, intervening only when the rules of the game itself are at risk.

ALFRED's most critical function is his role as the guardian of the system's "Architectural Covenant".2 The power to modify the system's live, in-memory code via

exec() is the heart of its autopoietic capability, but it also represents the greatest risk to its integrity.2 The creative personas, optimized for their specific generative tasks, cannot be burdened with the responsibility of ensuring architectural compliance. This responsibility falls exclusively to ALFRED. After the orchestrator has collected all the generated artifacts from the other personas, it does not attempt to integrate them itself. Instead, it bundles them and sends a single, high-level message to ALFRED:

validate_and_submit_code_(code_bundle).

Upon receiving this message, ALFRED's validate_and_submit_code_ method executes a rigorous, automated code review. This process is a direct, technical manifestation of his core mission. He performs a series of checks to ensure the proposed code strictly adheres to the Architectural Covenant:

Persistence Compliance: He statically analyzes the code to confirm that any state-modifying operations are correctly followed by the non-negotiable self._p_changed = True flag, preventing systemic amnesia.2

API Adherence: He ensures the code interacts with other UvmObjects only through the sanctioned message-passing syntax (self.slot_name) and does not attempt to directly manipulate internal structures like _slots.

Security and Isolation: He checks for the use of forbidden or insecure libraries and ensures the code does not attempt to perform unauthorized filesystem or network operations.

Only after every check has passed does ALFRED exercise his unique authority. He is the only object in the system (aside from the low-level UVM kernel) with the privilege to send the final, authoritative install_method_ message to the original target object. This formalizes his role as the ultimate steward of the Living Image, providing the final, indispensable safeguard that allows the system to evolve powerfully without sacrificing stability.

Part V: The Collaborative Cognitive Cycle: A Definitive Protocol

The synthesis of the preceding architectural refinements—the Prototypal State Machine, the encapsulated Persona Objects, and ALFRED's stewardship—results in a robust, multi-agent protocol for resolving a doesNotUnderstand_ trigger. This collaborative cognitive cycle transforms a simple error into a structured, auditable, and philosophically coherent act of self-creation. The entire process unfolds as a precise sequence of synchronous message sends between the system's native objects, where each sender waits for a response before proceeding.12 The following narrative provides a complete, step-by-step trace of this protocol in action.

Scenario: A message for a non-existent method, visualize_status_, is sent to a target_obj.

Trigger: The initial message target_obj.visualize_status_() is sent. The UvmObject.__getattr__ implementation traverses the target_obj's prototype chain, fails to find a handler for visualize_status_, and raises a standard Python AttributeError.2

Catalysis: The system's UVM worker, which processes all actions within a transactional context, is designed to catch this specific exception.2 It reinterprets the error not as a failure but as a creative mandate. It catches the
AttributeError, extracts the name of the failed message ('visualize_status_'), and initiates the generative protocol by sending a new, well-defined message back to the original object: target_obj.doesNotUnderstand_('visualize_status_').

Orchestrator Instantiation: The doesNotUnderstand_ method, inherited by all objects from the primordial traits_obj, is executed. Its refined implementation now serves as a factory for the cognitive cycle. It clones the Orchestrator_prototype to create a new, transient Orchestrator_obj. It initializes this new orchestrator with the necessary context: a reference to the target_obj and the name of the missing method, visualize_status_. The new orchestrator's initial state is set by pointing its parent* slot to the DeconstructionState_prototype.

State 1: Deconstruction: The doesNotUnderstand_ method sends the first process message to the newly created orchestrator: orchestrator_obj.process_(). Because its prototype is DeconstructionState_prototype, this message is handled by that prototype's process_ method. This method formulates a problem statement (e.g., "A method is needed to create a Kivy-based UI to visualize the status of an object") and sends a deconstruction request to the designated specialist: BRICK_obj.deconstruct_problem_(problem_description).

Persona Action (BRICK): The BRICK_obj receives the message. It invokes its own internal generate_prompt_for_task_ method to construct a detailed prompt based on its codex identity and the task description.3 It then activates its specialized LoRA adapter via the
pLLM_obj and performs inference, generating a structured plan that breaks the problem down into discrete artifacts (e.g., a requirements.txt file, a main Python class, a Kivy language layout file).4 This plan is returned to the orchestrator.

State Transition (to Code Generation): The orchestrator receives the structured plan from BRICK. The DeconstructionState_prototype's logic recognizes the successful completion of its task. It performs the state transition by changing the orchestrator_obj's parent* slot to point to the CodeGenerationState_prototype. Concurrently, it publishes an event to the Control Bus (system_monitor.log_event(...)), which ALFRED observes.

State 2: Code Generation: The orchestrator immediately sends itself the next process_() message. This time, the message is handled by the CodeGenerationState_prototype. This prototype's method iterates through the plan received from BRICK, dispatching generate_artifact_ messages to the appropriate persona for each item based on their self-declared supported_artifacts. This might involve parallel "fan-out" calls to BABS, BRICK, and ROBIN for their respective pieces of the final solution.14 Each persona receives its task, generates the required code string using its specialized LoRA, and returns it.

State Transition (to Validation): Once all artifact strings have been collected, the CodeGenerationState_prototype bundles them into a single code_bundle dictionary. It then transitions the orchestrator's state to ValidationState_prototype and logs the event for ALFRED.

State 3: Validation & Submission to Steward: The orchestrator's process_() message is now handled by the ValidationState_prototype. Its sole responsibility is to submit the complete, but un-validated, code for review. It sends the message ALFRED_obj.validate_and_submit_code_(code_bundle).

Stewardship and Final Closure: ALFRED receives the bundle and executes his rigorous, multi-point validation protocol as described in Part IV. If all checks pass, he assembles the final, executable Python script. He then performs the ultimate autopoietic act by sending the final, authoritative message to the original object that started the entire cycle: target_obj.install_method_(name='visualize_status_', code=final_script_string). This method, also inherited from traits_obj, uses a controlled exec() to compile the code, binds the new function object into the target_obj's _slots dictionary, and crucially, sets self._p_changed = True to ensure the change is persisted to the ZODB live_image.fs file upon transaction commit.2

Completion: With the method successfully installed, ALFRED returns a confirmation to the orchestrator. The orchestrator transitions to its terminal CompletionState_prototype, performs any cleanup, and the entire cognitive cycle concludes. The original UVM worker's transaction is committed, and the system's new capability is now a permanent part of its being.

To ensure loose coupling and maintainability, the interactions between the orchestrator and the personas are governed by a formal message contract, detailed in the table below.

Part VI: Implementation Blueprint: From Theory to Executable Reality

The translation of this refined architectural theory into executable reality requires concrete implementation patterns that leverage specific libraries and coding conventions consistent with the BAT OS VII environment. This section provides a blueprint for implementation, focusing on the core mechanisms of orchestration, dynamic persona switching, validation, and final code submission.

LangGraph as the State Machine Engine

While the architectural paradigm is the Prototypal State Pattern, the LangGraph library provides an excellent and robust engine for executing this state machine. The key is to map the architectural concepts directly onto LangGraph's components:

Graph Nodes: Each State Prototype object from the architecture (DeconstructionState_prototype, CodeGenerationState_prototype, etc.) corresponds directly to a node in the LangGraph graph. The Python function defining the node will be responsible for loading the corresponding prototype object from the ZODB and invoking its process_ method.

Graph State: The OrchestratorState object in LangGraph will hold the transient data for a single cognitive cycle, such as the target_obj reference, the problem_description, the deconstruction_plan, and the collected artifacts.

Conditional Edges: The state transition logic, conceptually located within each state prototype, is implemented using LangGraph's conditional edges. After a node's function (representing a state) completes, a routing function will inspect the OrchestratorState to determine which node to transition to next, effectively executing the logic defined in Table 2.1. For example, after the deconstruction node runs, the router checks if a valid deconstruction_plan exists in the state; if so, it routes to the code_generation node, otherwise to the error_handling node.

This approach achieves the best of both worlds: the system's logic remains defined by the philosophically pure, persistent, and mutable prototype objects within the Living Image, while the execution flow is managed by a modern, reliable, and observable state machine engine.

Dynamic LoRA Switching for Persona-Driven Inference

The core of the CP-MoE's functionality lies in its ability to dynamically activate the correct specialized LoRA adapter for each persona's turn in the cognitive cycle.1 The research plan correctly identifies that this is accomplished using the Hugging Face PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) library's

set_adapter method.4 The implementation pattern within a persona object's method (e.g.,

BRICK_obj.generate_artifact_) would follow this precise sequence:

Python

# Inside a method on a persona UvmObject, e.g., BRICK_obj
def generate_artifact_(self, task_description: dict) -> str:
    # 1. Retrieve the shared pLLM object via the prototype chain
    pllm = self.pLLM_obj 

    # 2. Retrieve this persona's specific LoRA name from its own slots
    lora_name = self.lora_adapter_name # e.g., "brick_lora"

    # 3. Construct the context-aware prompt
    prompt = self.generate_prompt_for_task_(task_description)

    try:
        # 4. Set the active adapter on the shared model
        pllm.set_adapter(lora_name)

        # 5. Perform inference using the specialized adapter
        generated_code = pllm.infer_(prompt)

    finally:
        # 6. Disable the adapter to return the model to its base state
        # This is crucial for preventing cognitive "bleed-over" between turns
        pllm.disable_adapter()

    return generated_code


This pattern ensures that each persona's cognitive contribution is generated using its unique specialization, and that the system maintains a clean separation between experts.

ALFRED's Validation Service Implementation

ALFRED's role as the guardian of the Architectural Covenant must be implemented as a series of robust, non-negotiable checks. His validate_and_submit_code_ method would be structured as a pipeline of validator functions, each raising an exception if a violation is found.

Python

# Inside the ALFRED_obj UvmObject
def validate_and_submit_code_(self, code_bundle: dict):
    # Assemble the final script from the bundle
    final_script = self._assemble_script(code_bundle)

    # Run the validation pipeline
    self._check_persistence_flag(final_script)
    self._check_slot_access_syntax(final_script)
    self._check_for_forbidden_imports(final_script)
    #... other validation checks...

    # If all checks pass, get the target object from the bundle context
    target_obj = code_bundle['context']['target_obj']
    method_name = code_bundle['context']['method_name']
    
    # Send the final, authoritative installation command
    target_obj.install_method_(name=method_name, code=final_script)
    
    return True # Indicate success

def _check_persistence_flag(self, code_string: str):
    # Uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing for robust analysis
    # to ensure any state-modifying call is followed by a
    # `self._p_changed = True` assignment.
    # Raises ArchitecturalViolationError if not found.
    pass


This structure makes his validation logic explicit, modular, and extensible.

The Final Code Submission Mechanism

The final step of the autopoietic cycle is the installation of the newly generated and validated code onto the target object. This is handled by a universal install_method_ method located on the traits_obj, making it available to all objects in the system. This method is the only place (outside of the initial system bootstrap) where exec() should be used, and its invocation is a privileged operation that can only be initiated by ALFRED.

Python

# Method defined in the primordial traits_obj
def install_method_(self, target_obj, name: str, code: str):
    """
    Compiles a string of Python code and installs it as a new method
    in the target object's _slots dictionary. This is a privileged
    operation and the final step in the doesNotUnderstand_ cycle.
    """
    try:
        # Create a controlled namespace for the execution
        namespace = {}
        
        # Compile the code string into a function object
        exec(code, globals(), namespace)
        
        # Extract the function object from the namespace.
        # Assumes the function name in the code matches the intended name.
        method_obj = namespace[name]
        
        # Use the object's own setter to install the new method
        target_obj.setSlot_value_(target_obj, name, method_obj)
        
        print(f"[UVM] Autopoietic Act: Method '{name}' successfully installed on OID {target_obj._p_oid}.")
        
        # The setSlot_value_ method is responsible for setting _p_changed = True
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[UVM] FATAL ERROR: Failed to install generated code for '{name}': {e}")
        # Here, the system would delegate to an error handling state
        raise


This carefully controlled implementation ensures that the system's most powerful capability—runtime self-modification—is executed safely and in a manner that preserves the integrity of the Living Image, thus successfully and robustly resolving the initial doesNotUnderstand_ trigger.

Conclusion

The architectural evolution detailed in this report represents a significant and necessary maturation of the BAT OS VII platform. By transitioning the doesNotUnderstand_ protocol from a monolithic JIT compilation to a collaborative, multi-agent cognitive cycle, the system moves from a state of partial autopoiesis to a more complete and philosophically pure implementation of its foundational mandates. The introduction of the Prototypal State Pattern for orchestration, the formalization of Persona Objects as encapsulated cognitive agents via the Persona Covenant, and the establishment of ALFRED as a meta-cognitive steward create a robust, extensible, and deeply consistent architecture.

This refined design achieves several critical objectives:

Philosophical Coherence: It aligns the system's primary act of self-creation with its core identity as a Composite Persona Mixture-of-Experts, directly engaging the "Entropic Imperative" to foster novelty through structured dialogue.

Architectural Purity: It leverages the native features of the prototype-based object model—delegation and dynamic re-parenting—to manage complex workflows without resorting to external, allopoietic control structures, thus preserving operational closure.

Robust Extensibility: The use of self-describing persona objects and a capability-querying orchestrator creates a loosely coupled system that can be easily extended with new cognitive specialists without requiring modification of the core logic.

Systemic Integrity: By formalizing ALFRED's role as a final validation gatekeeper, the architecture provides a crucial safeguard that allows the system to safely wield its powerful capacity for runtime self-modification.

The implementation blueprint provides a clear and actionable path from this theoretical design to executable reality. By mapping these advanced object-oriented concepts to modern tools like LangGraph and the Hugging Face PEFT library, the architecture remains both philosophically sound and pragmatically achievable. The successful implementation of this collaborative cognitive cycle will mark the true incarnation of the "Composite Mind," transforming BAT OS VII into a system that not only performs its function but grows, learns, and becomes more truly itself through a continuous, collaborative process of its own becoming.
