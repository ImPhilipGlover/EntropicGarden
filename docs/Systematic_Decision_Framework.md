# Systematic Decision Framework

**Purpose**: Provide structured decision-making templates for architectural choices with persistent audit trails and cross-session consistency.

## Core Decision Framework Architecture

### Decision Categories
1. **Prototypal Purity Decisions** - Ensuring code follows pure prototypal patterns
2. **Architectural Alignment Decisions** - System-level design choices within BAT OS vision
3. **Implementation Strategy Decisions** - Technical approach and tool selection
4. **Cross-Phase Integration Decisions** - Vertical slice and future compatibility choices
5. **Resource Allocation Decisions** - Priority, scope, and timing choices

## Decision Audit Trail

### Persistent Decision Log Format
```json
{
  "decisionId": "unique_identifier",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T10:30:00Z",
  "category": "prototypal_purity|architectural_alignment|implementation_strategy|cross_phase_integration|resource_allocation",
  "context": "Current situation description",
  "options": [
    {"id": "A", "description": "Option description", "analysis": "Detailed analysis"},
    {"id": "B", "description": "Option description", "analysis": "Detailed analysis"}
  ],
  "chosen": "A",
  "rationale": "Why this choice was made",
  "validation_criteria": "How to measure success",
  "agent_session": "session_identifier",
  "related_decisions": ["decision_id_1", "decision_id_2"]
}
```

### Decision Consistency Validation
- **Cross-Session Check**: Verify new decisions align with previous architectural choices
- **Prototypal Compliance**: Ensure all decisions maintain prototypal purity
- **BAT OS Coherence**: Validate alignment with overall system vision
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Confirm decisions are technically achievable

## Integration with Agent Workflow

### Pre-Decision Context Synthesis
```
DECISION_CONTEXT := {
    current_state := extract_system_state(),
    prior_decisions := load_decision_history(),
    architectural_constraints := apply_bat_os_principles(),
    prototypal_requirements := enforce_purity_mandates(),
    implementation_constraints := assess_technical_limits()
}
```

### Decision Execution Protocol
1. **Identify Decision Point**: Recognize when structured decision is needed
2. **Select Template**: Choose appropriate decision framework template
3. **Gather Context**: Synthesize all relevant information
4. **Generate Options**: Create 2-3 viable alternatives with analysis
5. **Apply Criteria**: Use framework-specific evaluation criteria
6. **Make Choice**: Select optimal option with clear rationale
7. **Document Decision**: Record in persistent audit trail
8. **Execute Plan**: Implement the chosen approach
9. **Validate Outcome**: Measure against success criteria

### Decision Review and Learning
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful decision patterns
- **Failure Analysis**: Learn from suboptimal choices
- **Template Evolution**: Improve decision frameworks based on experience
- **Cross-Session Wisdom**: Apply learnings to future agent sessions
