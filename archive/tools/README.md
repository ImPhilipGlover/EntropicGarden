# Archived Maintenance Utilities

Utility scripts in this directory were used for one-off maintenance tasks (for example, delimiter checks while repairing the Io loader). They are not part of the canonical toolchain. Keep new diagnostics either inside the maintained build scripts or under this archive once they are superseded.
