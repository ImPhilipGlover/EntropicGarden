- Completed Phase 1 physical substrate scaffolding across C, Io, and Python layers.
- Established canonical directory layout and C ABI contract (`synaptic_bridge.h`).
- Delivered prototypal Python worker architecture with GIL quarantine and shared memory scaffolding.
- Authored foundational Io concept prototype and persistence covenant hooks.
- Unified CMake polyglot build and smoke-tested architecture via `test_basic_architecture.py`.
- Implemented full C bridge skeleton (`synaptic_bridge.c`) with error protocol pending integration.
- Identified next priorities: IoVM handle lifecycle, shared memory bodies, federated memory caches.
